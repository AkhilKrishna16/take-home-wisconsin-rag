Sturdevant v. State, 76 Wis. 2d 247, 251 \nN.W.2d 50 (1977).\n\nJurisdiction over crimes committed by tribal members on the Menominee reser-\nvation is vested in the federal and tribal governments.

That is true even though the parcels \nin question are fully alienable, meaning their current owners can sell them at will.  \nUnder the facts of this case, the tribal lands were sold by past tribal owners to non-\nIndians before coming back into tribal ownership, but the one-time act of alienating \nreservation property to a non-Indian did not surrender the parcel[s tax immunity for \n\nall time.

Memory now sings a dream song, a faded \nlove theme song; the beautiful Wisconsin Waltz.Y\n(2)  The Wisconsin state dance is the polka.\n(3)  The Wisconsin state symbols are as follows:\n(a)  The mourning dove (zenaidura macroura corolinensis lin-\n\nnaus) is the symbol of peace.\n\n(b)  Milk is the state beverage.\n(c)  The sugar maple (acer saccharum) is the state tree.\n(d)  Corn (Zea mays) is the state grain.\n(e)  The wood violet (viola papilionacea) is the state flower.\n(f)  The robin (turdus migratorius) is the state bird.\n(g)    The  muskellunge  (Esox  masquinongy  masquinongy \n\nMitchell) is the state fish.\n\n(h)  The badger (taxidea taxus) is the state animal.\n(i)  The dairy cow (bos taurus) is the state domestic animal.\n(j)  The white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) is the state \n\nwildlife animal.\n\n(k)  The American water spaniel is the state dog.\n(L)  The honey bee (apis mellifera) is the state insect.\n(m)  The trilobite (calymene celebra) is the state fossil.\n(n)  Galena (lead sulfide) is the state mineral.\n(o)  Red granite is the state rock.\n(p)  Antigo silt loam (typic glossoboralf) is the state soil.\n(r)  The cranberry (vaccinium macrocarpon) is the state fruit.\n(s)  The tartan whose thread count is described in this para-\ngraph  is  the  state  tartan.    The  thread  count  for  the  state  tartan \nshall begin with 44 threads of muted blue, followed by 6 threads \nof scarlet, 4 threads of muted blue, 6 threads of gray, 28 threads \nof black, 40 threads of dark green, 4 threads of dark yellow, 40 \nthreads of dark green, 28 threads of black, 22 threads of muted \nblue, and 12 threads of dark brown, at which point the weave re-\nverses, going through 22 threads of muted blue, and continuing \nthe sequence in reverse order until the weave reaches the begin-\nning point of 44 threads of muted blue, at which point the weave \nreverses again.\n\n(t)  The kringle is the state pastry.\n(u)  Cheese is the state dairy product.\n\n1.08  State flag.  (1)  The Wisconsin state flag consists of the \nfollowing features:\n\n(a)  Relative dimensions of 2 to 3, hoist to fly.\n(b)  A background of royal blue cloth.\n(c)  The state coat of arms, as described under s. 1.07, in mate-\nrial of appropriate colors, applied on each side in the center of the \nfield,  of  such  size  that,  if  placed  in  a  circle  whose  diameter  is \nequal to 50 percent of the hoist, those portions farthest from the \ncenter of the field would meet, but not cross, the boundary of the \ncircle.\n\n(d)    The  word  XWISCONSINY  in  white,  capital,  condensed \nGothic letters, one-eighth of the hoist in height, centered above \nthe coat of arms, midway between the uppermost part of the coat \nof arms and the top edge of the flag.\n\n(e)    The  year  X1848Y  in  white,  condensed  Gothic  numbers, \none-eighth of the hoist in height, centered below the coat of arms, \nmidway between the lowermost part of the coat of arms and the \nbottom edge of the flag.\n\n(f)  Optional trim on the edges consisting of yellow knotted \n\nfringe.\n\n(2)  The department of administration shall ensure that all of-\nficial state flags that are manufactured on or after May 1, 1981 \nconform to the requirements of this section.  State flags manufac-\ntured before May 1, 1981 may continue to be used as state flags.\n\nHistory:  1979 c. 286.\n\n1.09  Seat of government.

Such statement shall also contain details of the beneficial \naspects of the proposed project, both short term and long term, \nand the economic advantages and disadvantages of the proposal.\n(d)  Prior to making any detailed statement, the responsible of-\nficial shall consult with and obtain the comments of any agency \nwhich has jurisdiction or special expertise with respect to any en-\nvironmental impact involved.  Copies of such statement and the \ncomments and views of the appropriate agencies, which are au-\nthorized to develop and enforce environmental standards shall be \nmade  available  to  the  governor,  the  department  of  natural  re-\nsources and to the public.  Every proposal other than for legisla-\ntion shall receive a public hearing before a final decision is made.  \nHolding  a  public  hearing  as  required  by  another  statute  fulfills \nthis section.  If no public hearing is otherwise required, the re-\nsponsible agency shall hold the hearing in the area affected.  No-\ntice of the hearing shall be given by publishing a class 1 notice, \nunder ch. 985, at least 15 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper \ncovering the affected area.

Holtz  & \nKrause, Inc. v.

Wisconsin[s  Environmental \nDecade, Inc. v. DNR, 94 Wis. 2d 263, 288 N.W.2d 168 (Ct.

Fox  v.  DHSS,  112  Wis.  2d  514,  334  N.W.2d  532 \n(1983).\n\nAn environmental impact statement is not required when the project will have mi-\nnor  impacts  on  the  environment  but  will  have  possible  socio-economic  impacts.   \nWisconsin[s Environmental Decade, Inc. v. DNR, 115 Wis. 2d 381, 340 N.W.2d 722 \n(1983).\n\nWhile the indirect secondary environmental effects may be influential in the con-\ntent of an environmental impact statement, they are not necessarily controlling in \ndetermining the threshold question of whether an environmental impact statement is \nto  be  prepared.    The  presence  of  significant  indirect  effects  or  cumulative  effects \nonly  increases  the  need  for  an  environmental  impact  statement.    Their  presence \nalone does not require an environmental impact statement.  Wisconsin[s Environ-\nmental Decade, Inc. v. DNR, 115 Wis. 2d 381, 340 N.W.2d 722 (1983).

Milwaukee Brewers Base-\nball Club v. DHSS, 130 Wis. 2d 56, 387 N.W.2d 245 (1986).\n\nWhen a state action did not come within an action type listed in Department of \nAdministration rules, an environmental assessment was required.  A determination \nfollowing an assessment that an environmental impact statement was not required \nfor a building constructed for the state by a private developer under a lease/purchase \nagreement  was  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.    Larsen  v.  Munz  Corp.,  167 \nWis. 2d 583, 482 N.W.2d 332 (1992).\n\nThe test as to whether an environmental impact statement (EIS) should be con-\nducted is one of reasonableness and good faith.  When conditions for approval that \ncompensate  for  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  imposed,  the  statutory \nthreshold of significant environmental impact is not crossed, and no EIS is required.  \nState ex rel. Boehm v. DNR, 174 Wis. 2d 657, 497 N.W.2d 445 (1993).\n\nSection 227.42 (1) does not grant a right to a contested case hearing regarding the \nneed for an environmental impact statement.
