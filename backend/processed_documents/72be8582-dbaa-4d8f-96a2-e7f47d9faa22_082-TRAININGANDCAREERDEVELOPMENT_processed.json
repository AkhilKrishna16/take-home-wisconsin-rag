The Milwaukee Police Department \n(MPD) provides basic recruit training and continuing education that exceeds requirements \nestablished by the state of Wisconsin Law Enforcement Standards Board (LESB) and the \nTraining  and  Standards  Bureau.  In  addition,  the  purpose  of  this  standard  operating \nprocedure is to ensure that the members of the Milwaukee Police Department are verifiably \ncompetent with all department policies and with the principles of fair and impartial policing. \nMembers  subordinate  to  the  rank  of  inspector  of  police  shall  follow  the  directives  of  the \ntraining  director  in  matters  relating  to  law  enforcement  certification  and  recertification \ntraining,  and  other  training  that  may  arise  relevant  to  members’  positions  or  work \nassignments. \n\n082.05   ANTI-RACIST and ANTI-DISCRIMINATORY POLICY TRAINING  \n\nThe  Milwaukee  Police  Department  is committed  to  the  implementation  of anti-racist  and \nanti-discriminatory policies throughout the department. To that end, every member of the \nMPD must annually complete at least four (4) hours of bias training, which includes training \non  anti-racist  and  anti-discriminatory  policies.  This  training  includes  a  special  focus  for \nsupervisors on detecting and reporting improper conduct. To demonstrate subject-matter \ncompetency, all members must successfully complete a written examination, including as \nto their understanding of MPD’s anti-racist and anti-discriminatory policies. Members who \nfail  the  examination  must  receive  immediate  remedial  training  until  the  member  can \ndemonstrate  core  competency.  MPD  members  must  pass  this  written  examination \nannually. \n\n082.10   CORRUPTION IN TRAINING PROHIBITED \n\nAny MPD member performing any training of any other MPD member is prohibited from \ndescribing  or counseling  on  how  to  avoid  culpability  for violating  MPD policy  or the  law.  \nEach  MPD  member  carries  an  affirmative  duty  to  report  any  such  commentary.  Any \nmember’s  failure  to  report  such  commentary  by  any  MPD  member  may  result  in  formal \ndiscipline.  Any  MPD  member  who,  while  training  any  other  MPD  member,  describes  or \ncounsels those other MPD members on how to lie or avoid culpability for violations of MPD \npolicy or the law may be discharged.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fGeneral Order 2024-20 \n\nTRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT \n\nPage 2 of 9 \n\n082.15   DE-ESCALATION TRAINING \n\nEvery member of the MPD must annually complete at least four (4) hours of scenario-based \ntraining  on  lawful  use-of-force  options,  focusing  on  skills  and  tactics  that  minimize  the \nlikelihood of using unlawful excessive force, including de-escalation tactics. Such tactics \nare actions and techniques used by law enforcement to slow down or stabilize a potentially \nunstable situation to allow for more time, options, and resources for resolution or prevention \nof an incident. Use of force is not a proper application of de-escalation tactics.  \n\n082.20  RECRUIT OFFICER BASIC TRAINING (WILEAG 12.2.3) \n\nSworn officers must satisfactorily complete the Wisconsin law enforcement basic training \ncurriculum  established  by  the  LESB  and  the  Training  and  Standards  Bureau  prior  to \nassignment to any duties that require them to unilaterally exercise police authority, carry a \ndepartment-issued firearm outside of training, and make arrests. \n\nIn addition, under this section officers must first pass a written examination covering  fair \nand  impartial  policing,  including  core  competency  of  MPD’s  SOP  001,  anti-racist,  anti-\ncompetency,  de-escalation  and  professional \ndiscriminatory  policies, \ncommunication. \n\ncultural \n\n082.25  ANNUAL IN-SERVICE AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING (WILEAG 12.1.3, 12.2.5) \n\nA.  The training director at the Training Division shall ensure that an in-service curriculum \nis designed and implemented each fiscal year to satisfy state training standards and the \nneeds of the department.  \n\n1.  Pursuant  to Wis.  Stat.  §  165.85(4)(a)(7),  certified  law  enforcement  officers  in  the \nstate of Wisconsin are required to attend a minimum of 24 hours of recertification \ntraining  each  fiscal  year  (July  1  through  June  30),  including  annual  firearms \ncertification and biennial LESB-required pursuit driving training.  \n\na.  The  biennial  LESB-required  pursuit  driving  training  shall  be  completed  with  a \n\nstate certified department instructor.   \n\nb.  Police members shall be required to complete their annual firearms certification \nwith  their  department  authorized  and  issued  firearm.  The  annual  firearms \ncertification  shall  be  completed  with  a  state  certified  department  firearms \ninstructor. \n\nNote:  LESB rules state the annual firearms certification and biennial LESB-\nrequired pursuit driving training must be administered by a certified \ninstructor  approved  by  the  officer’s  primary  employer.    If  a \ndepartment  member  goes  to  another  agency  or  academy  to  meet \nrecertification  requirements  without  the  approval  of  the  training \ndirector at the Training Division or an executive level officer (rank of \ninspector of police or above), the department will notify the Training \nand Standards Bureau and the state will not accept the training. \n(WILEAG 12.1.3.3) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fGeneral Order 2024-20 \n\nTRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT \n\nPage 3 of 9 \n\n2.  Members  who  do  not  complete  the  state’s  minimum  training  requirements  face \ndecertification  by  the  LESB  and  are  subject  to  discipline  up  to  and  including \ndismissal from the department. \n\nB.  In-service training shall satisfy the LESB recertification requirement for sworn members \nsubordinate to the rank of captain of police. Ordinarily captains of police and above will \nnot be required to attend in-service training at the Training Division, however, they may \ndo so to meet the LESB recertification requirement. Primary instructors shall either be \nLESB-certified,  operate  under  the  direction  of  an  LESB-certified  instructor,  or  have \nprofessional  credentials  and  experience  clearly  establishing  their  expertise  in  the \ncurriculum.  \n\nC.  Members  assigned  to  attend  in-service  or  specialized  training  shall  appear  on  the \ndesignated dates and times unless excused by a supervisor. Supervisors shall notify \nthe  Training  Division  of  expected  absences  and  work  cooperatively  with  Training \nDivision staff to re-schedule missed training as soon as possible.  \n\nD.  Specialized  training  is  intended  to  complement  in-service  instruction,  providing \nmembers opportunities to reinforce their existing knowledge, learn additional skills, and \nexpand  abilities  in  their  areas  of  interest.  Primary  instructors  shall  either  be  LESB-\ncertified,  operate  under  the  direction  of  an  LESB-certified  instructor,  or  have \nprofessional  credentials  and  experience  clearly  establishing  their  expertise  in  the \ncurriculum. \n\nE.  All training that occurs on duty time, whether or not it occurs at the  Training Division, \nshall  be  approved  by  the  training  director,  or  designee.  Training  developed  and \ndelivered by specialty units shall also be approved by commanding officers in control of \nspecialized police functions, in conjunction with the Training Division. This is to ensure \nthat lesson concepts align with department policy, strategy, and law enforcement best \npractices.  The  training  director  at  the  Training  Division,  the  director  of  Human \nResources,  and  the  Chief  of  Police  are  ultimately  responsible  for  the  training  and \ndevelopment of Milwaukee Police Department employees. \n\nFor the purposes of this section, specialized police functions include: \n\n  The Hazardous Devices Unit \n  The Tactical Enforcement Unit \n  The Motorcycle Unit \n  The Marine Operations – Harbor Patrol Unit \n  The Crisis Negotiation Unit \n  The Fusion Division \n  The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \n  The Canine Unit \n\n082.30  REMEDIAL TRAINING (WILEAG 12.2.9) \n\nRemedial training is intended to correct or improve deficiencies in performance. Remedial \ntraining  is  not  discipline  and  shall  not  be  presented  as  such.  It  is  intended  to  improve \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fGeneral Order 2024-20 \n\nTRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT \n\nPage 4 of 9 \n\nmembers’ abilities and confidence in the performance of their duties. \n\nA.  Deficiencies in performance leading to remedial training may be identified through: \n\n  Field training officers’ observations and evaluations \n  Performance evaluations \n  Supervisors’ observations and evaluations in the field \nInternally generated complaints or substantiated claims by department members  \n \n  Externally-generated  complaints  or  substantiated  claims  by  non-department \n\nmembers \n\nB.  Supervisors shall recommend remedial training using a Department Memorandum (form \nPM-9E) and forward the request through the chain of command to the training director at \nthe  Training  Division.  If  remedial  training  is  requested  in  conjunction  with  an  internal \ninvestigation, the affected member’s bureau commander shall be notified of the request. \nNothing in this policy is intended to prevent members from requesting remedial training \nfor  themselves  if  they  believe  that  additional  instruction  is  necessary  for  the  proper \nperformance of their duties. \n\nC.  The training director, deputy director, or a lieutenant at the Training Division shall decide \nif remedial training is necessary after reviewing the request and any other documentation, \nvideos, or images, necessary to make the determination. \n\nD.  Members  in  need  of  remedial  training  shall  be  notified  in  writing  of  the  circumstances \nleading to the determination as well as the date, time, and location of the training. The \ntraining director, or designee, shall ensure that remediation occurs within 28 days of the \nmember’s  notification.  Exceptions  to  this  time  limit  must  be  approved  by  the  deputy \ntraining director at the Policy Academy or a higher ranking officer. \n\nE.  Remedial training shall be provided by LESB-certified instructors, either assigned to the \nTraining Division or under the direction of a master instructor if trainers are not assigned \nto  the  Training  Division.  The  training  objectives  and  expected  outcomes  must  be \napproved  by  a  training  coordinator  assigned  to  the  Training  Division  at  the  rank  of \nlieutenant or above. \n\nF.  When remedial training has been successfully completed, trainers shall forward scores, \ncertifications,  outcomes,  or  other  relevant  results  to  the  training  director’s  office  for \ninclusion in the member’s training record. Trainers shall make all reasonable efforts to \nensure that members successfully complete remedial training. If a member is unable to \nmeet course objectives and display the required proficiencies, the training director or a \ndesignee  shall  notify  the  commanding  officer  of  the  Administration  Bureau,  who  shall \ndetermine the next course of action.  \n\nG.  Refusal to participate in remedial training may result in discipline. Refusal or inability to \nsuccessfully  complete  remedial  training,  including  but  not  limited  to  training  in  state-\nmandated curriculum, could result in decertification by the LESB and dismissal from the \ndepartment. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fGeneral Order 2024-20 \n\nTRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT \n\nPage 5 of 9 \n\n082.35  ORIENTATION FOR NON-SWORN EMPLOYEES (WILEAG 12.2.8) \n\nNewly  appointed  non-sworn/civilian  personnel  shall  attend  new  employee  orientation \nprovided by the city of Milwaukee.

We  are  responsible  stewards  of  the  public’s  resources,  therefore, \nmembers shall exercise prudence in ensuring that the most reasonable and cost-effective \noptions are chosen. The city of Milwaukee will not issue reimbursements for expenses that \nare deemed unnecessary, unreasonable, or inappropriate. \n\nA.  REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES OVERVIEW \n\nMembers incurring reimbursable expenses as a result of approved travel or training are \nexpected  to  pay  for  the  expenses  in  advance  and  apply  for  reimbursement  upon  the \nconclusion of the course, conference, or trip, using the Statement of Expenses Incurred \nfor  the  City  of  Milwaukee  (form  CBP-211).  The  statement  of  expenses  form  must  be \nsubmitted to Budget and Finance within 10 days of the completion of travel or the end of \ntraining. \n\n1.  Reimbursable  expenses  are  those  that  directly  relate  to  the  member’s  training  or \nofficial department business. Entertainment, alcoholic beverages, fines for violations, \nexpenses for damage, travel upgrades, and extra amenities will not be reimbursed. \n\n2.  Along  with  form  CBP-211,  members  shall  include  receipts,  online  payment \nconfirmation  pages,  or  other  documentation  that  clearly  displays  expense  and \npayment.  Receipts  or  acceptable  documentation  of  payment  shall  accompany  any \nitem for which a member requests reimbursement. Receipts are not required for meals \n(see  section  C.

With approval  from  a bureau  commander,  airfare  may  be  reimbursed  or  advanced \nmore than two weeks prior to travel, but hotel and meal allowances will be advanced \nno earlier than one week prior to travel.  \n\nNote:  Only  one  travel  advance  per  trip  will  be  allowed,  so  members  should \ncarefully plan and submit one Authorization for Travel Advance form for \nairfare, hotel, and meal allowances when appropriate. \n\n2.  Receipts  and  documentation  related  to  travel  advances  and  repayment  of  unused \nfunds  must  be  submitted  to  Budget  and  Finance  within  10  days  of  the  member’s \nreturn.
