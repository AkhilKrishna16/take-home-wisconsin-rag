After placing the suspect under arrest, the officer \nwill say something similar to: “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and \nwill be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney. If you cannot afford \nan attorney, one will be appointed for you.” \n\nMiranda Rights were created in 1966 as a result of the United States Supreme Court case of \nMiranda v. Arizona. The Miranda warning is intended to protect the suspect’s Fifth Amendment \nright to refuse to answer self-incriminating questions. \n\nWhat do my rights mean? \n\nWhen contacted by the police, individuals have the duty to stop and if requested to identify \nthemselves.  That is all. Although it would best serve to be polite and courteous.  \n\nYou have the right to remain silent. This means it is your constitutionally protected right. To \nexercise your right, you must remain silent.
