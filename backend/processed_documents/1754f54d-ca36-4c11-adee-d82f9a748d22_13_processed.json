The estimate shall also indicate whether any increased \n\ncosts incurred by the state under the bill can be mitigated through \nthe  use  of  contractual  service  contracts  let  in  accordance  with \ncompetitive procedures.  For purposes of this paragraph, a bill in-\ncreasing or decreasing the liability or revenues of the unemploy-\nment reserve fund is considered to increase or decrease state fis-\ncal liability or revenues.

If such a bill con-\ntains a provision providing a tax exemption, the bill shall be si-\nmultaneously  referred  to  the  joint  survey  committee  on  tax  ex-\nemptions and the joint committee on finance.  The report of the \njoint  survey  committee  on  tax  exemptions  shall  be  prepared \nwithin 60 days of introduction for bills introduced under s. 16.47 \n(1).\n\nHistory:  1971 c. 17; 1977 c. 29, 317; 1979 c. 34, 283; 1981 c. 20 s. 2n; 1981 c. \n27 s. 1; Stats. 1981 s. 13.093; 1983 a. 8, 27; 1987 a. 4; 1989 a. 31; 2001 a. 16; 2003 \na. 139; 2005 a. 89, 316.\n\n13.095  Review  of  programs  started  with  federal  aid.   \nState agencies responsible for the administration of federal con-\ntract  or  grant-in-aid  programs  shall  promptly  notify  the  federal \naid  management  service  of  the  department  of  administration \nwhenever  any  program  or  project,  financed  wholly  or  partially \nfrom federal aids, would have to be continued from state funds \nbecause federal aid will be or has been curtailed or withdrawn or \nbecause the federal program from which the aid was received has \nor will be expired.  The federal aid management service under s. \n16.545 shall promptly notify the joint committee on finance of all \nnotifications received from state agencies.

The legislature finds and determines that supporting \nentrepreneurs and innovators, providing facilities for job training, \nand  promoting  dynamic  community  revitalization  and  develop-\nment are of vital importance in creating jobs and contributing to \neconomic development and tourism in this state and are statewide \nresponsibilities of statewide dimension.  It is therefore in the pub-\nlic interest, and it is the public policy of this state, to assist the In-\ncourage Community Foundation, Inc., in redeveloping the former \nDaily Tribune building in the city of Wisconsin Rapids into an \neconomic and community hub.\n\n2.

(b)  would  greatly \nbenefit  state  residents  by  expanding  access  to  timely  inpatient \nmental health treatment and other behavioral health services and \nallowing  public  financial  resources  to  be  better  distributed  to \nmore effectively improve delivery of mental health services and is \na statewide responsibility of statewide dimension.  It is therefore \nin the public interest, and it is the public policy of this state, to ex-\npand  psychiatric  bed  capacity  and  behavioral  health  treatment \ncapacity.\n\n(b)  The building commission may authorize up to $5,000,000 \nin general fund supported borrowing to make a grant for the pur-\npose of renovating an existing mental health facility in Marathon \nCounty.

The organization agrees to annually report to the legisla-\nture,  in  the  manner  described  under  s.  13.172  (2),  the  services \nprovided with the resources funded by the grant awarded under \nthis  subsection,  including  the  number  of  individuals  diverted \nfrom state-operated mental health institutes.\n\n5.

The  legislature  further  determines  that  sufficient  private \ncapital has been and continues to be unavailable to fulfill the need \nfor the development of broadband Internet access in unserved ar-\neas in this state.  It is therefore in the public interest, and it is the \npublic policy of this state, to assist the public service commission \nin making broadband expansion grants under s. 196.504 (2) (a) \nfor the purpose of constructing broadband infrastructure in un-\nserved areas of this state.\n\n(c) \n\n  The  building  commission  may  authorize  up \n\nto \n$125,000,000 in general fund supported borrowing.

The  legisla-\nture also finds and determines that the youth of the city of Mil-\nwaukee are disproportionately represented in the state[s juvenile \n\ncorrectional system and that, because those youth are so dispro-\nportionately represented, the state has a specific concern in pre-\nventing  those  youth  from  engaging  in  delinquent  behavior,  en-\ncouraging positive moral development in those youth and provid-\ning  those  youth  with  opportunities  for  positive  interaction  with \nthe police.
