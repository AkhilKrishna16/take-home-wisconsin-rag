It  is  the  intent  of  the  legislature  to  encourage  private \ncontributions and land dedications under the Wisconsin natural \nareas heritage program.  It is the intent of the legislature to match \nprivate contributions and the value of land dedications with state \nfunds in addition to funds normally appropriated for natural areas \nland acquisition activities.\n\n(2)  CONTRIBUTIONS; STATE MATCH.  The department may ac-\ncept contributions and gifts for the Wisconsin natural areas her-\nitage program.  The department shall convert donations of land \nwhich it determines, with the advice of the council, are not appro-\npriate for the Wisconsin natural areas heritage program into cash.  \nThe  department  shall  convert  other  noncash  contributions  into \ncash.  These moneys shall be deposited in the conservation fund \nand credited to the appropriation under s. 20.370 (1) (fu).  These \nmoneys shall be matched by an equal amount released from the \nappropriation  under  s.  20.866  (2)  (ta),  (tt),  or  (tz)  or  from  any \ncombination of these appropriations to be used for natural areas \nland  acquisition  activities  under  s.  23.27  (5).

If the \nland dedication involves the transfer of the title in fee simple ab-\nsolute or other arrangement for the transfer of all interest in the \nland to the state, the valuation shall be based on the fair market \nvalue of the land prior to the transfer.  If the land dedication in-\nvolves the transfer of a partial interest in land to the state, the val-\nuation shall be based on the extent to which the fair market value \nof the land is diminished by that transfer and the associated arti-\ncles of dedication.  If the land dedication involves a sale of land to \nthe department at less than the fair market value, the valuation of \nthe dedication shall be based on the difference between the pur-\nchase price and the fair market value.  An amount equal to the \nvalue of land accepted for dedication under the Wisconsin natural \nareas heritage program shall be released from the appropriation \nunder s. 20.866 (2) (ta), (tt) or (tz) or from any combination of \nthese appropriations to be used for natural areas land acquisition \nactivities under s. 23.27 (5).  This subsection does not apply to \ndedications of land under the ownership of the state.  The depart-\nment shall determine how the moneys being released are to be al-\nlocated from these appropriations.\n\n(4)  LAND  DEDICATIONS;  ELIGIBLE  LAND.    The  department \nmay not accept land for dedication under the Wisconsin natural \nareas  heritage  program  unless  the  land  is  a  natural  area  with  a \nhigh or critical level of importance as determined by the depart-\nment with the advice of the council.\n\n(5)  LAND DEDICATIONS; TRANSFER OF INTEREST.  The depart-\nment may not accept land for dedication under the Wisconsin nat-\nural areas heritage program unless all interest in the land or a par-\ntial interest in the land is transferred to the state to be held in trust \nfor the people by the department.
