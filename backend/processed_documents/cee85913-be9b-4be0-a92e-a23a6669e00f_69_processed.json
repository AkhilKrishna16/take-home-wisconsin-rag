(1) (f) 1. b. is not a gender-specific statute violating the right to equal protec-\n\ntion.  Steinbach v. Gustafson, 177 Wis. 2d 178, 502 N.W.2d 156 (Ct. App. 1993).\n\nEnforcement of surrogacy agreements promotes stability and permanence in fam-\nily relationships because it allows the intended parents to plan for the arrival of their \nchild, reinforces the expectations of all parties to the agreement, and reduces con-\ntentious litigation.  The surrogacy agreement in this case was enforceable except for \nthe portions of the agreement requiring a voluntary termination of parental rights \n(TPR).  The TPR provisions did not comply with the procedural safeguards set forth \nin s. 48.41 for a voluntary TPR because the biological mother would not consent to \nthe TPR and there was no legal basis for involuntary termination.  The TPR provi-\nsions were severable.  Rosecky v. Schissel, 2013 WI 66, 349 Wis. 2d 84, 833 N.W.2d \n634, 11-2166.\n\nArkansas state law generally requires the name of the mother[s male spouse to ap-\npear on the child[s birth certificate, regardless of his biological relationship to the \nchild, but did not require that birth certificates include the female spouses of women \nwho gave birth in the state.  That differential treatment infringes the commitment of \nObergefell, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), to provide same-sex couples the constellation of \nbenefits that the states have linked to marriage.  Under Obergefell, a state may not \nexclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as \nopposite-sex couples.  Pavan v. Smith, 582 U.S. 563, 137 S. Ct. 2075, 198 L.
