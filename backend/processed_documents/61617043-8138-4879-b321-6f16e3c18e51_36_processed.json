Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 120 S. Ct. 1346, 146 L. Ed. 2d 193 \n(2000).\n\nWith one exception, the university[s system, as required by Southworth, 529 U.S. \n217 (2000), for distributing compelled fees collected from university students to stu-\ndent groups that delegates funding decisions to the student government was subject \nto sufficient limits.  Southworth v. Board of Regents, 307 F.3d 566 (2002).\n\nAlthough the 1st amendment establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution nei-\nther compels nor authorizes the university to categorically exclude funding of activ-\nities related to worship, proselytizing, and sectarian religious instruction with segre-\ngated fees, the university may nevertheless be able to exclude some or all of the ac-\ntivities to which it objects.  The university is free to enact viewpoint neutral rules re-\nstricting access to segregated fees, for it may create what is tantamount to a limited \npublic forum if the principles of viewpoint neutrality are respected.  However, be-\nfore excluding an activity from the segregated fee forum pursuant to a content-based \ndistinction,  the  university  must  explain  specifically  why  that  particular  activity, \nviewed as a whole, is outside the forum[s purposes.

OAG 1-04.\n\nStudent body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race \nin university admissions.  A race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota \nsystem, but may consider race or ethnicity as a plus factor for an applicant, without \ninsulating the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available \nseats.  An admissions program must be flexible enough to consider all pertinent ele-\nments of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to \nplace them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily accord-\ning them the same weight.  Race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in \ntime.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304 (2003).  \nSee also Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 123 S.

Ed. 2d 857 (2023).\n\nUnder Grutter, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), strict scrutiny must be applied to any univer-\nsity admissions program using racial categories or classifications.  Once the univer-\nsity has established that its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, how-\never, there must still be a further judicial determination that the admissions process \nmeets  strict  scrutiny  in  its  implementation.    The  university  must  prove  that  the \nmeans chosen by the university to attain diversity are narrowly tailored to that goal.  \nStrict scrutiny imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, be-\nfore turning to racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral alterna-\ntives do not suffice.  Grutter did not hold that good faith would forgive an impermis-\nsible consideration of race.  Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, \n133 S. Ct. 2411, 186 L. Ed. 2d 474 (2013).

Unless the \nboard  review  panel  grants  the  request  for  review,  the  recom-\nmended findings of fact and decision of the faculty hearing com-\nmittee shall be the final decision of the board.\n\n(c)  If after a hearing, the faculty hearing committee[s recom-\nmended findings of fact and decision are that the initial decision \nwas  improper,  the  chancellor  shall  review  the  matter  and  give \ncareful consideration to the committee[s finding.  If the chancel-\nlor  accepts  the  committee[s  findings,  the  chancellor[s  decision \nshall be final.

The period of the faculty member[s appointment has ex-\n\npired under its own terms.\n\n2.  The faculty member is reappointed to the position from \nwhich he or she was laid off.  Failure to accept a reappointment \nterminates the faculty member[s association with the system.\n\n3.  The faculty member accepts an alternative continuing po-\nsition in the system.

The \nboard, representing this state, shall enter into an agreement meet-\ning the requirements of this subsection with the designated body \nrepresenting the state of Minnesota.\n\n(b)  The agreement under this subsection shall provide for the \nwaiver of nonresident tuition for residents of either state who are \nenrolled in public institutions of higher education located in the \nother state.  The agreement shall also establish a reciprocal fee \nstructure for residents of either state who are enrolled in public \ninstitutions of higher education located in the other state.  The re-\nciprocal fee may not exceed the higher of the resident tuition that \nwould be charged the student at the public institution of higher \neducation in which the student is enrolled or the resident tuition \nthat would be charged the student at comparable public institu-\n\ntions  of  higher  education  located  in  the  student[s  state  of  resi-\ndence,  as  specified  in  the  annual  administrative  memorandum \nunder par.

The agreement is subject to the approval of the \njoint committee on finance.\n\n(c)  Prior to each academic year, the board and the designated \nbody representing the state of Minnesota shall prepare an admin-\nistrative  memorandum  that  establishes  policies  and  procedures \nfor implementation of the agreement for the upcoming academic \nyear, including a description of how the reciprocal fee structure \nshall be determined for purposes of par. (b), and the board shall \nsubmit  the  administrative  memorandum  to  the  joint  committee \non finance. If the cochairpersons of the committee do not notify \nthe board that the committee has scheduled a meeting for the pur-\npose  of  reviewing  the  administrative  memorandum  within  14 \nworking days after the date of the submittal, the administrative \nmemorandum may be implemented as proposed by the board.  If, \nwithin  14  working  days  after  the  date  of  the  submittal,  the \ncochairpersons of the committee notify the board that the com-\nmittee has scheduled a meeting for the purpose of reviewing the \nadministrative  memorandum,  the  administrative  memorandum \nmay be implemented only upon approval of the committee.\n\n(d)    No  resident  of  this  state  whose  name  appears  on  the \nstatewide support lien docket under s. 49.854 (2) (b) may receive \na waiver of nonresident tuition under this subsection unless the \nresident provides to the board a payment agreement that has been \napproved by the county child support agency under s. 59.53 (5) \nand that is consistent with rules promulgated under s. 49.858 (2) \n(a).\n\n(e)  At the end of each semester or academic term, the board \nand the designated body representing the state of Minnesota shall \ndetermine the number of students for whom nonresident tuition \nhas been waived under the agreement.

The entity \nwith the larger reimbursement obligation shall pay as provided in \nthe  agreement  an  amount  determined  by  subtracting  the  reim-\nbursement  obligation  of  the  entity  with  the  smaller  reimburse-\nment obligation from the reimbursement obligation of the entity \nwith the larger reimbursement obligation.  The agreement shall \nprovide a reasonable date for payment of any such sums due and \nowing, after which date interest may be charged on the amount \nowed.  The methodology for determination of the appropriate in-\nterest rate shall be included in the agreement.  All tuition and fees \nreceived by this state under this subsection and any net obliga-\ntions received under this paragraph shall be credited to the appro-\npriation account under s. 20.285 (1) (gb).\n\n(f)  In allocating funding for each institution under s. 36.09 (1) \n(h),  the  board  shall  ensure  that  each  institution  is  allocated  the \namounts  received  pursuant  to  par.

(1) \nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE.  The purpose of this section is to pro-\nmote the permanent conservation and enhancement, by the Uni-\nversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, of the area known as Downer \nWoods;  to  designate  and  protect,  as  a  permanent  conservancy \narea, at least 10 acres of the woods; and to permit limited modifi-\ncation, in a manner consistent with the aforesaid purposes, of that \nportion of the woods whose present character as park and wood-\nland lends itself to utilization, by the university and the surround-\ning community, as essential recreational and aesthetic corridors.\n\n(2)  LEGISLATIVE  FINDINGS.    The  legislature  finds  it  in  the \npublic interest to recognize and foster the principle of environ-\nmental quality in the area known as Downer Woods by preserv-\ning it as a conservancy area and protecting it, consistent with sub. \n(4), from encroachment or disparate uses.  The woods is the sole \nremaining natural area remaining on the campus of the University \nof  Wisconsin-Milwaukee,  and  as  such,  its  preservation  and  en-\nhancement  is  consistent  with  the  university[s  recognition  of  its \nneed to protect and enhance its own physical environment, and to \nserve the pressing human need of its faculty, students and staff, as \nwell as the greater Milwaukee community, to live and work in an \nurban  environment  which  respects  those  portions  of  unspoiled \nnature which yet exist.  The woods is a unique asset; it provides \nvisual relief to the concentrated building pattern surrounding it, \ncomplements the urban landscape and affords aesthetically and \npsychologically attractive places for people to congregate and re-\nlax.    In  addition,  the  woods  serves  as  a  refuge  for  wildlife  and \nvegetation, and is, therefore, an important educational, scientific \nand ecological resource to the university and the community.  Its \npresence imparts priceless recreational and aesthetic values.\n\n(3)  DEFINITIONS.  In this section, XDowner WoodsY or Xthe \nwoodsY  means  those  parcels  of  wood,  parkland  and  buildings \ncomprising more than 21.4337 acres located on the campus of the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and divided into 5 separate \nand distinct categories, which categories shall define the proper \nand permissible uses of the parcels, as follows:\n\n(a)  Permanent conservation area, consisting of 11.101 acres, \nwhich is to be physically defined by means of fencing or other \nsuitable means.\n\n(b)    Permanently  reserved  woodland,  consisting  of  3.018 \n\nacres.\n\n(c)  Park and woodland areas, consisting of 4.686 acres, which \nmay be subject to limited modification, such as landscaping, but \nwhich are to be protected from disparate uses and encroachment.\n(d)  The buildings and grounds of the former Downer college \nwith any reconstruction or renovation which may be authorized \nby the board.\n\n(e)    Park  and  woodland  areas,  consisting  of  2.6287  acres, \nwhich may be subject to limited modifications, such as landscap-\ning and utility lines.\n\n(4)  DOWNER  WOODS  CONSERVATION.

The chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-\nMilwaukee,  through  the  University  of  Wisconsin-Milwaukee \nField Station, shall prepare and implement a Downer Woods nat-\nural area management and restoration plan to ensure that the con-\nservation area is managed properly as a natural area.\n\n(b)  That portion of Downer Woods designated as permanently \nreserved woodland shall be set aside exclusively for purposes of \ncommunity enhancement and relaxation, and any disparate uses \nto or encroachments upon such land is prohibited except for the \npurpose  of  constructing  an  addition  and  providing  service  to \nSandburg Hall, which may not exceed 0.75 acres.  The board shall \ngrant a temporary easement sufficient to facilitate the construc-\ntion  of  the  addition,  and  whenever  necessary  to  facilitate  the \nmaintenance of Sandburg Hall, conditioned upon the ecological \nrestoration of the area within the easement.\n\n(c)  Those portions of Downer Woods designated as park and \nwoodland areas under sub. (3) (c) and (e) may be used by the Uni-\nversity  of  Wisconsin-Milwaukee  as  recreational  and  aesthetic \ncorridors.  Any modifications made to such portions of the woods \nunder sub. (3) (c) and (e) may not significantly alter the present \ncharacter  of  such  land,  and  any  disparate  uses  to  or  encroach-\nments upon such land are prohibited.\n\n(d)  The buildings of the former Downer college shall be pre-\nserved  and  no  portion  thereof  may  be  razed  without  prior  ap-\nproval of the building commission.\n\nHistory:  1973 c. 335; 1975 c. 386; 1997 a. 226.\n\n36.40  Use  of  animals  for  research  purposes.
