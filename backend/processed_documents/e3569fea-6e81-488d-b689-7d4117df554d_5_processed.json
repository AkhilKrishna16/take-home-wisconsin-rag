A Xboard of election commissionersY is established in Wiscon-\nsin[s high population cities and counties to carry out the duties otherwise accom-\nplished by municipal and county clerks everywhere else.  The phrase Xmunicipal \nclerk or board of election commissionersY appears in tandem all over the election \nstatutes  because  that  describes  the  duties  of  local  election  officials.    State  ex  rel. \nZignego v. Wisconsin Elections Commission, 2021 WI 32, 396 Wis. 2d 391, 957 \nN.W.2d 208, 19-2397.\n\nThe XofficeY of a clerk and a Xmunicipal clerkY are distinct terms.  In elections \nstatutes, when XofficeY is used in conjunction with a reference to the clerk, such Xof-\nficeY is specified as a place where a delivery or an action takes place.  The Xmunic-\nipal clerkY is a person, while the Xoffice of the municipal clerkY is a location.  Prior-\nities  USA  v.

Students may use \ncollege-issued  credentials  under  sub.  (6m)  (f),  but  only  before  an  ID[s  expiration \ndate.  There[s nothing wrong with a requirement that IDs be current.  Luft v. Evers, \n963 F.3d 665 (2020).\n\nTreating students differently from other potential voters without a rational basis \nviolates the equal protection clause.  Under sub. (6m) (f), a student identification \ncard, alone among the sorts of photo ID that Wisconsin accepts, is not sufficient for \nvoting unless the student also shows proof of current enrollment.  No other category \nof acceptable identification depends on ongoing affiliation of any sort.  That differ-\nential treatment violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.  Luft v. Evers, 963 F.3d 665 (2020).\n\nThe requirements in sub. (6m) (f) that a student identification card must display:  \n1) an issuance date; 2) an expiration date; 3) an expiration date not more than two \nyears after the issuance date; and 4) a signature, are rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental  interest  and  do  not  violate  the  equal  protection  clause.

Notwithstanding s. 778.06, \na civil action or proposed civil action authorized under this para-\ngraph may be settled for such sum as may be agreed between the \nparties.  Any settlement made by the commission shall be in such \namount as to deprive the alleged violator of any benefit of his or \nher wrongdoing and may contain a penal component to serve as a \ndeterrent to future violations.  In settling civil actions or proposed \ncivil actions, the commission shall treat comparable situations in \na comparable manner and shall assure that any settlement bears a \nreasonable relationship to the severity of the offense or alleged \noffense.  Except as otherwise provided in sub.

(c) 11., 14., \n15., and 16. and s. 978.05 (1).  For purposes of this subsection, \nthe commission may only initiate an investigation of an alleged \nviolation of chs. 5 to 10 and 12, other than an offense described \nunder par. (c) 12., based on a sworn complaint filed with the com-\nmission, as provided under par. (c).  Neither the commission nor \nany member or employee of the commission, including the com-\nmission administrator, may file a sworn complaint for purposes \nof this subsection.\n\n(c)  2.  a.

No later than 5 days \nafter receiving a complaint, the commission shall notify each per-\nson who or which the complaint alleges committed such a viola-\ntion.  Before voting on whether to take any action regarding the \ncomplaint, other than to dismiss, the commission shall give each \nperson receiving a notice under this subd. 2. a. an opportunity to \ndemonstrate to the commission, in writing and within 15 days af-\nter receiving the notice, that the commission should take no ac-\ntion against the person on the basis of the complaint.  The com-\nmission may not conduct any investigation or take any other ac-\ntion under this subsection solely on the basis of a complaint by an \nunidentified complainant.\n\nam.  If the commission finds, by a preponderance of the evi-\ndence, that a complaint is frivolous, the commission may order \nthe complainant to forfeit not more than the greater of $500 or the \nexpenses  incurred  by  the  commission  in  investigating  the \ncomplaint.\n\n4.  If the commission reviews a complaint and fails to find \nthat there is a reasonable suspicion that a violation under subd. 2. \nhas  occurred  or  is  occurring,  the  commission  shall  dismiss  the \ncomplaint.    If  the  commission  believes  that  there  is  reasonable \nsuspicion that a violation under subd. 2. has occurred or is occur-\nring, the commission may by resolution authorize the commence-\nment  of  an  investigation.    The  resolution  shall  specifically  set \nforth any matter that is authorized to be investigated.  To assist in \nthe investigation, the commission may elect to retain a special in-\nvestigator.  If the commission elects to retain a special investiga-\ntor, the administrator of the commission shall submit to the com-\nmission the names of 3 qualified individuals to serve as a special \ninvestigator.  The commission may retain one or more of the indi-\nviduals.  If the commission retains a special investigator to inves-\ntigate a complaint against a person who is a resident of this state, \nthe  commission  shall  provide  to  the  district  attorney  for  the \ncounty in which the person resides a copy of the complaint and \nshall notify the district attorney that it has retained a special in-\nvestigator to investigate the complaint.  For purposes of this sub-\ndivision, a person other than an individual resides within a county \nif the person[s principal place of operation is located within that \ncounty.  The commission shall enter into a written contract with \nany  individual  who  is  retained  as  a  special  investigator  setting \nforth the terms of the engagement.  A special investigator who is \nretained by the commission may request the commission to issue \na subpoena to a specific person or to authorize the special investi-\ngator to request the circuit court of the county in which the spe-\ncific person resides to issue a search warrant.  The commission \nmay grant the request by approving a motion to that effect at a \nmeeting of the commission if the commission finds that such ac-\ntion is legally appropriate.\n\n5.  Each special investigator who is retained by the commis-\nsion shall make periodic reports to the commission, as directed \nby the commission, but in no case may the interval for reporting \nexceed  30  days.

During the pendency of \nany investigation, the commission shall meet for the purpose of \nreviewing the progress of the investigation at least once every 90 \ndays.  The special investigator or the administrator shall report in \nperson to the commission at that meeting concerning the progress \nof the investigation.

The commission shall not expend more \nthan $25,000 to finance the cost of an investigation before receiv-\ning a report on the progress of the investigation and a recommen-\ndation  to  commit  additional  resources.    The  commission  may \nvote to terminate an investigation at any time.  If an investigation \nis terminated, any complaint from which the investigation arose is \ndeemed to be dismissed by the commission.  Unless an investiga-\ntion is terminated by the commission, at the conclusion of each \ninvestigation, the administrator shall present to the commission \none of the following:\n\na.  A recommendation to make a finding that probable cause \nexists to believe that one or more violations under subd. 2. have \noccurred or are occurring, together with a recommended course \nof action.\n\nb.

A recommendation to terminate the investigation due to \nlack of sufficient evidence to indicate that a violation under subd. \n2 has occurred or is occurring.\n\n6.  a.  If the commission finds that there is probable cause to \nbelieve that a violation under subd. 2. has occurred or is occur-\nring, the commission may authorize the commission administra-\ntor to file a civil complaint against the alleged violator.  In such \ncase,  the  administrator  may  request  the  assistance  of  special \ncounsel to prosecute any action brought by the commission.  If \nthe administrator requests the assistance of special counsel with \nrespect to any matter, the administrator shall submit to the com-\nmission the names of 3 qualified individuals to serve as special \ncounsel.  The commission may retain one of the individuals to act \nas special counsel.  The staff of the commission shall provide as-\nsistance to the special counsel as may be required by the counsel \nto carry out his or her responsibilities.\n\nb.  The commission shall enter into a written contract with \nany individual who is retained as special counsel setting forth the \nterms of the engagement.  The contract shall set forth the com-\npensation to be paid such counsel by the state.  The contract shall \nbe  executed  on  behalf  of  the  state  by  the  commission  and  the \ncommission shall file the contract in the office of the secretary of \nstate.    The  compensation  shall  be  charged  to  the  appropriation \nunder s. 20.510 (1) (br).\n\n7.  No individual who is appointed or retained by the com-\nmission to serve as special counsel or as a special investigator is \nsubject to approval under s. 20.930.\n\n9.    At  the  conclusion  of  its  investigation,  the  commission \nshall,  in  preliminary  written  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions \nbased thereon, make a determination of whether or not probable \ncause exists to believe that a violation under subd. 2. has occurred \nor is occurring.  If the commission determines that no probable \ncause exists, it shall dismiss the complaint.  Whenever the com-\nmission dismisses a complaint or a complaint is deemed to be dis-\nmissed  under  subd.  5.,  the  commission  shall  immediately  send \nwritten  notice  of  the  dismissal  to  the  accused  and  to  the  party \nwho made the complaint.\n\n10.  The commission shall inform the accused or his or her \n\ncounsel of exculpatory evidence in its possession.\n\n11.  If the commission finds that there is probable cause to \nbelieve that a violation under subd. 2. has occurred or is occur-\nring, the commission may, in lieu of civil prosecution of any mat-\nter by the commission, refer the matter to the district attorney for \nthe county in which the alleged violator resides, or if the alleged \nviolator  is  a  nonresident,  to  the  district  attorney  for  the  county \nwhere the matter arises, or if par.

For purposes of this subdivision, a \nperson other than a natural person resides within a county if the \nperson[s  principal  place  of  operation  is  located  within  that \ncounty.\n\n12.  The commission shall, by rule, prescribe categories of \ncivil  offenses  which  the  commission  will  agree  to  compromise \nand settle without a formal investigation upon payment of speci-\nfied amounts by the alleged offender.  The commission may au-\nthorize the commission administrator to compromise and settle \nsuch  alleged  offenses  in  the  name  of  the  commission  if  the  al-\nleged  offenses  by  an  offender,  in  the  aggregate,  do  not  involve \npayment of more than $2,500.\n\n13.  If a special investigator or the commission administrator, \nin the course of an investigation authorized by the commission, \ndiscovers  evidence  that  a  violation  under  subd.  2.  that  was  not \nwithin the scope of the authorized investigation has occurred or is \noccurring,  the  special  investigator  or  the  administrator  may \npresent that evidence to the commission.  If the commission finds \nthat there is a reasonable suspicion that a violation under subd. 2. \nthat is not within the scope of the authorized investigation has oc-\ncurred or is occurring, the commission may authorize the special \ninvestigator or the administrator to investigate the alleged viola-\ntion or may elect to authorize a separate investigation of the al-\nleged violation as provided in subd. 4.\n\n14.  If a special investigator or the commission administrator, \nin the course of an investigation authorized by the commission, \ndiscovers evidence of a potential violation of a law that is not ad-\nministered by the commission arising from or in relation to the \nofficial functions of the subject of the investigation or any matter \nthat involves elections, the special investigator or the administra-\ntor may present that evidence to the commission.  The commis-\nsion may thereupon refer the matter to the appropriate district at-\ntorney specified in subd. 11. or may refer the matter to the attor-\nney general.  The attorney general may then commence a civil or \ncriminal prosecution relating to the matter.\n\n15.  Except as provided in subd. 17., if the commission refers \na matter to the district attorney specified in subd. 11. for prosecu-\ntion of a potential violation under subd. 2. or 14. and the district \nattorney informs the commission that he or she declines to prose-\ncute any alleged civil or criminal violation related to any matter \nreferred to the district attorney by the commission, or the district \nattorney fails to commence a prosecution of any civil or criminal \nviolation related to any matter referred to the district attorney by \nthe commission within 60 days of the date of the commission[s \nreferral, the commission may refer the matter to the district attor-\nney for another prosecutorial unit that is contiguous to the prose-\ncutorial unit of the district attorney to whom the matter was orig-\ninally referred.
