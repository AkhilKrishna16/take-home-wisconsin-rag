The YJ system in Wisconsin is community based, designed to serve the greatest number \nof youth through local prevention and diversion services and reduce the number served out-of-\nhome. \n\nBecause Wisconsin’s YJ system is state supervised and county administered, counties determine \nand maintain the structure of their courts and the human services agencies providing YJ services. \nIn  2016,  DCF  assumed  responsibility  for  fiscal  and  programmatic  oversight  of  Wisconsin’s \ncommunity-based youth justice (YJ) system. These responsibilities include training, maintaining \ndata  systems,  development  of  standards,  and  capacity  building  through  technical  assistance. \nDCF  has  developed  these  standards  in  accordance  with  statutory  authority  under  section      \n48.526(10),  Wis.  Stats.  Chapter  938  of  Wisconsin  Statutes  governs  administration  of  the  YJ \nsystem, including requirements that both courts and local human/social services agencies must \nfollow. Standards do not include all statutory requirements.  \n\nSECTION 1: CASE PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION \n\nIntroduction:  \n\nThe  following  standards  support  best  practices  related  to  case  process,  documentation  of \nreferrals, intake decisions, court decisions and case closure.  \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n2 \n\n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 1: Case Process and Documentation \n\nI.  Documentation of Referral and Intake Information  \n\nI.A.  Receipt of Referral.  \nAll referrals received by a county agency under Wis. Stat. s. 938.24 shall be documented as \na Youth Justice Referral in eWiSACWIS within 3 business days of the date they are received. \n\nI.B.  Transfer of Referral.  \nIf a referral is transferred from one county to another during the intake process, the county \nthat originally received the referral shall reassign it in eWiSACWIS within 3 business days of \nthe decision to transfer. The agency conducting the intake inquiry under 938.24 shall then \ndocument further case management. \n\nI.C.  Courtesy Supervision.  \nIf a case requires courtesy supervision, staff in the receiving county shall have an \nassignment created for the case and the responsibility of courtesy supervision shall be \nindicated.  \n\nI.D.  Intake Recommendations.  \nAll intake recommendations regarding whether to close case, enter into a Deferred \nProsecution Agreement, or file a formal Petition made by a county agency under 938.24(5) \nshall be documented in eWiSACWIS within 3 business days of the date they are made. \n\n•  All decisions to close case shall have a corresponding reason documented.  \n\nII.  Documentation of Court Decisions and Dates  \n\nII.A. DA Decision and DA Decision Date. \nThe prosecutor’s decision regarding whether to close case, enter into a Deferred \nProsecution Agreement, or proceed with a formal Petition, and the date the decision was \nrendered, shall be entered within 20 business days of notification of the decision. \n\n• \n\nIf no notification is received, the decision shall be entered no later than 30 days \nfrom the date the intake recommendation was sent to the prosecutor. The date \nentered shall be the final day the prosecutor could have sent notification (20 days \nafter intake recommendation was sent). \n\nII.B.

Regular Review of Data Elements  \n\nDuring ongoing case work, the case record shall be maintained to ensure demographics, \ncontact information, addresses, and involvement status is current for all youth, parents, and/or \nguardians, plus other participants currently active in the YJ case. Data shall be reviewed for \naccuracy at least every six months.  \n\nV.  Documentation of Conclusion of Youth Justice Work  \n\nDate County Supervision Ended shall be entered, contact information shall be reviewed and \nconfirmed, and the “Completed” checkbox shall be marked complete within 30 days of the date \nthat a DPA is completed, or a Consent Decree or Dispositional Order expires or is terminated.  \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 2: YASI \n\nSECTION 2: YOUTH ASSESSMENT SCREENING INSTRUMENT \nIntroduction  \n\nThe Youth Assessment Screening Instrument (YASI) measures a youth’s level of risk, needs, \nresponsivity factors, and strengths to guide early decision-making and assignment of case \nresources, as well as assist in the development of targeted case plans. The YASI looks to \nidentify both the dynamic (changeable) and static (unchangeable) risk factors of youth to help \nprofessionals manage their caseloads and better structure and target services to youth with \nhigher needs.  \n\nThe YASI is an instrument specially designed for youth and assesses across ten domains that \nmany years of research suggest are correlated with an increased likelihood of future re-referral \nfor the same offense. \n\nLegal History \n\nFamily \n\nSchool \n\nCommunity/Peer \n\nAlcohol/drugs \n\nMental Health \n\nViolence/ \n\nAggression \n\nAttitudes \n\nSkills \n\nEmployment/ \n\nFree Time \n\nYASI focuses on the factors that are most critical to promoting positive outcomes for youth. \nThe information collected during assessment guides the creation of a case plan tailored to an \nindividual’s identified needs and strengths. The entire assessment and case planning process is \ninformed by motivational interviewing and is designed to engage youth, provide them a sense of \nownership over their case plan, and match supervision and intervention strategies with the \nyouth’s levels of risk and motivation. \n\nWhy use a Risk Assessment tool? \n\nUse of an assessment tool helps us be more targeted and effective \n\n•  Research on the use of validated assessments in youth justice has grown significantly in \nthe last decade. Assessment tools are often described as the foundation of evidence-\nbased practice.  \n\n•  Youth justice professionals should not intervene more or less than is necessary. A \n\nvalidated assessment tool helps us match youth with the most effective level and type \nof supervision and services.  \n\n•  Assessment tools assist jurisdictions with increasing the efficient use of resources, \nimproving outcomes for youth and families, and increasing community safety.  \n\n•  Research shows that youth who are scored as low risk by a validated assessment and \n\nare diverted from the YJ system recidivate at lower rates than comparable youth whose \ncases are formally processed through the court system. (Wilson & Hoge, 2012). \n\nUse of an assessment tool informs and supports professional decision-making  \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n5 \n\n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 2: YASI \n\n•  A risk, needs, and strengths assessment tool informs and supports professional \n\ndecision-making; it does not replace it.  \n\n•  Use of an assessment tool should not create a lot of additional work. In the long run, it \n\nshould make caseloads more manageable. Youth who will not benefit from intervention \nwill be screened out, while priority need areas for youth in need of YJ services will be \nhighlighted to help identify areas of focus to promote positive behavioral change. \n\nUse of an assessment tool provides consistency across the state  \n\n•  Use of a statewide tool standardizes data collection on youth referred to the YJ system \n\nand provides a common measuring stick to assess state-level trends.  \n\n•  Use of a statewide tool provides a common language across counties and stakeholder \n\ngroups.  \n\nIncorporating the YASI in county practice \n\nTo complete a YASI assessment, semi-structured interviews are conducted to gather \ninformation needed to score items included in CaseWorks software. It is best practice to \ninterview youth, their family, and any other appropriate collateral contacts. Collateral \ninformation can come from the school, family members, or other resources/contacts that the \nyouth or family identifies.  Releases of information should be obtained before speaking with any \ncollateral contacts.  \n\nIn general, all youth referred for delinquency who have no competency or capacity concerns \nshould be assessed with a YASI Pre-Screen prior to a petition being filed and all youth brought \nbefore juvenile court should be given the YASI Full Assessment prior to disposition. In the latter \ninstance, results from the YASI will serve as a guide for recommendations for the dispositional \ncourt report. All youth placed on supervision will assist their case worker via the feedback \nprocess to develop a case plan informed by the results of their assessment. \n\nYouth who generally should not have a Pre-Screen administered include the following: \n\n•  Youth referred for truancy. While the YASI has been validated for use in delinquency \n\ncases, it has not been validated for use with truancy. As truancy is a status offense and \nis not a strong predictor of future delinquency, it is recommended counties use a \nvalidated needs assessment tool for truancy referrals. Although not required, if a JIPS \nreferral results in an adjudication, a worker may administer the YASI Full Assessment to \nsupport dispositional recommendations and case planning. However, particular \nattention should be given to the youth’s identified needs, rather than their risk level. (See \nalso Standard VII.(3) and VII.(4).) \n\n•  Youth with capacity or competency concerns. When a YJ professional has concerns \n\nregarding a youth’s competency (e.g. suspected cognitive disability, learning disability, \nyoung age) or capacity (e.g. suspected mental health crisis, intoxication, acute effects of \na traumatic experience), the professional should not ask the youth to participate in the \nYASI assessment process. They should identify another time to complete the \nassessment when the youth either is deemed competent or well enough to participate in \nthe interview. (See also Standard VI.(2)(b). and VIII.(f).) \n•  Youth under the age of 10. (See also Standard VI.(2)(a).) \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n6 \n\n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 2: YASI \n\nIn addition, because the YASI is primarily validated for delinquency, the Pre-Screen should not \nbe administered to youth referred for JIPS cases (including truancy) unless the present referrals \nentail evidence of specific delinquent behavior, and then only optionally. (For these youth, the \nYASI may be primarily useful for case planning; see, e.g., Standard VII.(3) and VII.(4).) \n\nFinally, for youth who deny referred offense(s), Pre-Screen items pertaining to the offense(s) \nshould be scored neutrally, and the Full Assessment should not be administered until the youth \nadmits or is adjudicated delinquent. (See also Standard VI.(1)(a).) \n\nInterview Practice Guidance \n\nThe assessment portion of the YASI is rooted in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), \nan evidence-based approach to behavior change. MI is designed to facilitate the natural process \nof change, while also honoring autonomy, so a successful YASI interview is more than simply \nreading questions and recording answers.  Instead, engage the youth in conversation \nencompassing the domains assessed in the YASI, and take notes sufficient to answer its \nquestions once all the information is collected. The YASI Administration Guides and other \nmaterials provided during CaseWorks training can help a worker ensure they are covering all \ndomains during the interview. \n\nThe following interview strategies can help to get you started:  \n\n  Whenever possible, ensure the interview with the youth takes place in a comfortable \n\nsetting. \n\n  Check in with the youth and provide opportunities for questions. \n  Encourage the youth to correct you if you make an inaccurate statement. \n  The administration of the assessment is most effective when the principles and \n\ntechniques associated with MI, such as OARS (below), are utilized. \n\no  Open-ended questions \no  Affirmations \no  Reflections \no  Summarization \n\n  Assessments that consist of 5-10 minutes of engagement, time for the assessment, and \n\n5-10 minutes for closing the conversation are most effective. \n\no  Questions for engagement are open questions that invite the person to share \ntheir perspectives, presenting concerns, general experiences/views, and \ninformation about themselves. \n\no  Questions for closing the conversation are open questions that target change. \nAsk about the person’s motivation or reasons for changing behavior, perceived \nimportance for change, willingness, or readiness to change, how change could \nhappen, or possible next steps. \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fVI. Administration of the YASI Pre-Screen  \n\n(1) The YASI pre-screen must be administered for delinquency referrals, post-referral, pre-\n\npetition for consenting youth who appear at the intake conference. \n\nYouth Justice Standards \nSection 2: YASI \n\n(a)  No questions regarding the offense may be asked during the administration of \n\nthe pre-screen if a youth is denying the charges. In this scenario, the YJ \nprofessional would answer offense-related assessment items neutrally and \nproceed with the remaining assessment items.  \n\n(b)  Additional attempts to reach youth must be made when youth do not appear at \n\nthe intake conference. Attempts shall be documented. \n\n(c)  If a youth is held in detention, attempts to administer the pre-screen via phone or \n\nin-person pre-petition must be made. Attempts shall be documented. \n\n(d)  An unwillingness or inability to complete the pre-screen does not mandate formal \n\nprocessing of the youth. \n\n(e)  If the intake recommendation does not align with a youth’s risk level, the \n\nreason(s) for the override shall be documented and approved by a supervisor. \n\n(2) No portion of the YASI pre-screen may be administered in the following cases: \n\n(a)  The pre-screen should not be administered for youth under the age of 10. \n\n(b)  The pre-screen should not be administered if the youth’s capacity to complete it \n\nis in question. The reason for the exception shall be documented. \n\n(3) If the referral is for a youth who has previously been on supervision, the most recent \n\nclosing reassessment should be copied, carried forward, a new interview with the youth \nshall be conducted and a new Caseworks initial assessment1 shall be completed.  \n\nVII.  Serving Youth Identified as Low Risk for Re-referral \n\n(1) Whenever possible youth identified as low risk for re-referral should not be \n\nrecommended for a petition or a deferred prosecution agreement.  \n\n(2) Youth identified as low risk for re-referral who are placed on a deferred prosecution \n\nagreement should not receive the full YASI assessment, unless the DPA is cancelled and \na petition is filed. Then policy VII.(3) applies.  \n\n(3) Youth at low risk for re-referral, who are petitioned, who have low protective scores and \nhave not received another specialized assessment (e.g., mental health, sex offender, \nsubstance use disorder) shall receive the YASI full assessment to inform dispositional \n\n1 The “new initial assessment” term is used in Caseworks software when a new assessment is created; \nnot to be confused with CPS Initial Assessment. \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 2: YASI \n\nrecommendations and case planning. \n\n(4) Any obligations for youth identified as low-risk and low-strength shall include services \n\nfocused on increasing youth strengths. Services shall be limited to only what is \nnecessary to achieve the identified goals. \n\n(5) Youth identified as low risk for re-referral who have been placed on a consent decree do \n\nnot need to be reassessed. \n\n(6) Youth identified as low risk for re-referral shall receive the fewest contacts possible to \n\nachieve the case plan objectives. \n\n(7) Youth identified as low risk for re-referral may be recommended for early termination of \n\nsupervision at the discretion of the department. \n\nVIII.  Administration of the YASI Full Assessment  \n\n(1) The full assessment must be administered pre-disposition for all consenting \n\ndelinquency referred youth determined to be at medium or high risk for re-referral. If \ncourt proceedings do not allow for the full assessment to be completed prior to \ndisposition, the full assessment should be completed as soon as possible post-\ndisposition to inform the case plan. \n\n(a)  No portion of the full assessment beyond the pre-screen \n\nquestions may be administered if a youth is denying the charges \nuntil after the adjudication hearing. \n\n(b)  No portion of the full assessment may be administered to children \n\nunder the age of 10. \n\n(c)  If a consent decree will be recommended by the prosecutor or \n\ndefense counsel, prior to entering into the consent decree, a full \nassessment should be administered if there will be services \nrecommended. If court proceedings do not allow for the full \nassessment to be completed prior to the consent decree being \nentered, the full assessment should be completed as soon as \npossible thereafter to inform the case plan if a case plan is \ndetermined appropriate in the youth’s case. \n\n(d)  If a youth will admit to the charges or will plead no contest, the full \n\nassessment may be administered pre-adjudication. \n\n(e)  The full assessment should not be administered if the youth’s \ncapacity to complete it is in question. The reason for the \nexception shall be documented. \n\n(f)  If a youth’s competency is in question, the full assessment may \n\nnot be administered until the court determines the youth has been \nrestored to competency. \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n9 \n\n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 2: YASI \n\n(g)  An unwillingness or inability to complete the pre-screen does not \n\nmandate formal processing of the youth. \n\n(2) The full assessment must include interviews with the youth and, whenever possible, \n\ninterviews with family/guardian. \n\n(3) The full assessment must include a review of all relevant collateral information and, \nwhenever possible, interviews with collateral contacts. Attempts to reach collateral \ncontacts for interview shall be documented.  \n\n(4) The youth’s priority need areas, protective factors and services recommended must be \n\nincorporated into the court report to aid in making recommendations. If court \nproceedings do not allow for these to be incorporated in the court report prior to \ndisposition, they must be used to inform and develop the case plan with youth and \nfamily post disposition.  \n\n(5) When information gathered for the full assessment or the full assessment results \n\nindicate the possible need for another assessment (e.g., mental health, sex offender, \nsubstance use disorder), the youth should receive a specialized assessment \nadministered by a qualified professional. \n\n(6) If service recommendations do not align with a youth’s risk level and priority need areas, \n\nthe reason(s) for the override shall be documented and approved by a supervisor. \n\n(7) Changes to a completed assessment shall be documented. \n\nIX. YASI Case Planning  \n\n(1) The case plan must be informed by the full assessment and address the youth’s priority \n\nneed areas. \n\n(2) Services recommended in the case plan should be matched to the youth’s priority need \n\nareas.  \n\n(3) The case plan must be created with the youth and family no later than 45 days after the \n\ndisposition hearing.   \n\n(4) The case planning process shall begin with Feedback to the youth (and family when \n\navailable) on the results of the YASI Full Assessment and mapping process. \n\n(5) Using the Feedback Wheel as a template, Feedback to the youth shall include:  \n\nthe behavior that needs to change (i.e., offense or other problem behavior) \n\n- \n-  all identified strengths or protective factors \n-  challenges (i.e., needs) as reflected in up to 3 priority domains and associated \n\ntargets \nincentives for change identified by the youth \ninvitation to the youth to identify where they would like to start \n\n- \n- \n\n(6) Goals shall be developed collaboratively with the youth, framed in positive language, and \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 2: YASI \n\nidentify outcomes desired by the youth. \n\n(7) One or more measurable action steps shall be identified with the youth as the services, \n\nsupports, or skills that will help attain each of the goals.  \n\n(8) The case plan shall be submitted to a supervisor for review and approval. \n\n(9) The case plan shall be provided to the youth, family, and members of the team. \n\n(10) The case plan and documentation that the plan was received by the youth and family \n\nshall be maintained in the record. \n\n(11)  The case plan must be modified based on the results of reassessment and updated \n\nwhen youth complete a service or achieve their goals. \n\n(12)  Planned contacts made with the youth or family must be driven by the case plan for \nthe purpose of evaluating the identified needs and strengths, services, and goals. All \ncontacts shall be documented. \n\n(13)  Youth shall receive the fewest contacts possible to achieve the case plan objectives. \n\n(14)  Case plan goals and progress should be reviewed with the youth, family, and members \n\nof the team, no less than once per month and more often if warranted by supervision \nintensity, to ensure the action steps remain in focus. Reviews of goals and progress \nshall be documented. Recommendations for early termination of supervision should \nbe considered when case plan objectives have been achieved. \n\nX.  YASI Reassessment \n\n(1) Reassessment must occur at least every 6 months for youth at medium or high risk for \n\nre-referral. \n\n(2) Any major life events (death, divorce, family member incarceration, major incident, \n\nsignificant school events, etc.) should trigger a possible reassessment, pending a review \nwith a supervisor to determine whether a reassessment is in fact necessary. \n\n(3) A reassessment must be completed if there is a motion to vacate the consent decree, a \nnew petition is filed, or there is a question of whether the youth should be removed from \nthe community. \n\n(4) The reason for reassessment shall be documented. \n\n(5) The final reassessment must occur at the time of case closure. The results of the final \n\nassessment shall not be the sole determinant for extending the court order. \n\nXI. YASI Training Requirements  \n\n(1) All child welfare professionals who have oversight of or makes decisions in YJ cases \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n11 \n\n \n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 2: YASI \n\nmust receive YASI training on how to administer and utilize the YASI pre-screen and full \nassessment prior to independent administration. \n\n(2) Any supervisor who has oversight of or makes decisions in YJ cases must receive YASI \ntraining on how to administer and utilize the YASI pre-screen and full assessment prior \nto independent supervision of staff, including supervisor support training. \n\n(3) Any supervisor or child welfare professional who have oversight of or makes decisions \n\nin YJ cases must receive YASI training on how to utilize the case plan in conjunction with \nthe results of the pre-screen and full assessment prior to creating a case plan with a \nyouth and family. \n\n(4) All child welfare professional and supervisors who have oversight of or makes decisions \nin YJ cases must complete annual booster trainings in accordance with the options \navailable through DCF and the Wisconsin Child Welfare Professional Development \nSystem.  \n\nXII.  YASI Duties of the Supervisor \n\n(1) A supervisor must provide consultation to workers administering the YASI pre-screen \n\nand full assessment (includes reassessment). \n\n(2) A supervisor must review the results of the pre-screen and approve recommendations \n\nfor petitions to the court.  \n\n(3) A supervisor must review and approve a full assessment prior to disposition. \n\n(4) A supervisor must review the case plan and recommended services.  \n\n(5) A supervisor must review reassessments within 15 days of completion. \n\n(6) A supervisor must approve any recommendations for early termination of supervision.   \n\n(7) All duties identified above performed by the supervisor must be documented.  \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nSection 3: Out of Home Care \n\nSECTION 3: OUT OF HOME CARE \nXII.A. Out of Home Care \nThe Ongoing Services Standards for Child Welfare Out-Of-Home Care Cases apply to Youth \nJustice Out-of-Home Care Placements. \n\n10/1/2023 \n\n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fYouth Justice Standards \nYouth Justice Related Concepts \n\nYouth Justice Related Concepts \n\nAdjudication: Judicial determination (judgment) that a juvenile is responsible for the delinquency or \nstatus offense that is charged in a petition or other charging document. \n\nBest practice: Strategies and programs demonstrated through research and evaluation to be effective at \npreventing or intervening in juvenile delinquency. Best practice models include program models that have \nbeen shown, through rigorous evaluation and replication, to achieve target outcomes. Model programs \ncan come from many valid sources (e.g., OJJDP's Model Programs Guide, Blueprints for Violence \nPrevention, SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices, OJP’s \nCrimeSolutions.gov, and State model program resources). \n\nDelinquency: An act committed by a juvenile that would be criminal if committed by an adult.
