 upon  whom  levied.   \nTaxes shall be levied, under this chapter, upon all general prop-\nerty  in  this  state  except  property  that  is  exempt  from  taxation.   \nReal estate taxes and personal property taxes are deemed to be \nlevied when the tax roll in which they are included has been de-\nlivered to the local treasurer under s. 74.03.  When so levied such \ntaxes are a lien upon the property against which they are charged.  \nThat  lien  is  superior  to  all  other  liens,  except  a  lien  under  s. \n292.31 (8) (i) or 292.81, and is effective as of January 1 in the \nyear when the taxes are levied.  Liens of special assessments of \nbenefits for local improvements shall be in force as provided by \nthe charter or general laws applicable to the cities that make the \n\nspecial assessments.  In this chapter, unless the context requires \notherwise, references to Xthis chapterY do not include ss. 70.37 to \n70.395.\n\nHistory:  1977 c. 29 s. 1646 (3); 1977 c. 31, 203; 1987 a. 378; 1993 a. 453; 1995 \n\na. 227; 1997 a. 27.\n\nThe  enactment  of  this  chapter  did  not  supersede  the  Milwaukee  city  charter, \nwhich  exempts  from  taxation  property  leased  by  the  city.

Beginning with the property tax assessments \nas of January 1, 2024, no tax shall be levied under this chapter on \npersonal property.\nHistory: 2023 a. 12.\n\n70.02  Definition of general property.  General property is \nall the taxable real property defined in ss. 70.03 and 70.04 except \nthat which is taxed under ss. 70.37 to 70.395 and ch. 76 and sub-\nchs. I and VI of ch. 77.  General property includes manufacturing \nproperty  subject  to  s.  70.995,  but  assessment  of  that  property \nshall be made according to s. 70.995.\n\nHistory:  1973 c. 90; 1977 c. 31; 1979 c. 221; 1985 a. 29 s. 3202 (39) (c); 2023 a. \n\n12.\n\n70.03  Definition of real property.  (1)  In chs. 70 to 76, 78, \nand 79, Xreal property,Y Xreal estate,Y and XlandY include not only \nthe land itself but all buildings and improvements thereon, and all \nfixtures and rights and privileges appertaining thereto, except as \nprovided in sub. (2) and except that for the purpose of time-share \nproperty, as defined in s. 707.02 (32), real property does not in-\nclude recurrent exclusive use and occupancy on a periodic basis \nor other rights, including, but not limited to, membership rights, \nvacation services, and club memberships.\n\n(2)  XReal propertyY and Xreal estateY do not include any per-\nmit or license required to place, operate, or maintain at a specific \nlocation one or more articles of personal property described un-\nder s. 70.04 (3) or any value associated with the permit or license.\nHistory:  1979 c. 89; 1983 a. 432; 1987 a. 399; 1993 a. 308; 1995 a. 225; 2013 a. \n\n20; 2015 a. 196.\n\nIncome that is attributable to land, rather than personal to the owner, is inextrica-\nbly intertwined with the land and is transferable to future owners.  This income may \nbe included in the land[s assessment because it appertains to the land.  Income from \nmanaging separate off-site property may be inextricably intertwined with land and \nsubject to assessment if the income is generated primarily on the assessed property \nitself.  ABKA Ltd. Partnership v. Board of Review, 231 Wis. 2d 328, 603 N.W.2d \n217 (1999), 98-0851.\n\n70.04  Definition of personal property.  In chs. 70 to 79, \nXpersonal propertyY includes all of the following:\n\n(1g)  All goods, wares, merchandise, chattels, and effects, of \nany  nature  or  description,  having  any  real  or  marketable  value, \nand  not  included  in  the  term  Xreal  property,Y  as  defined  in  s. \n70.03.\n\n(1r)  Saw logs, timber, and lumber, either upon land or afloat; \nsteamboats, ships, and other vessels, whether at home or abroad; \nferry boats, including the franchise for running the same; ice cut \nand stored for use, sale, or shipment; and manufacturing machin-\nery and equipment, as defined in s. 70.11 (27).\n\n(2)  Irrigation implements used by a farmer, including pumps, \npower units to drive the pumps, transmission units, sprinkler de-\nvices, and sectional piping.\n\n(3)  An off-premises advertising sign.  In this subsection, Xoff-\npremises advertising signY means a sign that does not advertise \nthe business or activity that occurs at the site where the sign is \nlocated.\n\nHistory:  1973 c. 90; 1973 c. 336 s. 36; 1979 c. 89; 1983 a. 27 s. 2202 (45); 1995 \n\na. 225; 2013 a. 20; 2015 a. 196; 2023 a. 12; s. 35.17 correction in (1r).\n\n70.045  Taxation district defined.  Except as provided in s. \n70.114 (1) (e), in this chapter, Xtaxation districtY means a town, \nvillage  or  city  in  which  general  property  taxes  are  levied  and \ncollected.\n\nHistory:  1989 a. 336; 1991 a. 39 s. 3714.\nA utility district established under s. 66.0827 is not a taxation district under this \nsection, which means the utility district may not impose property taxes at all; only \nthe municipality may do so.  Although a town may establish a utility district, the \ntown itself levies the taxes to fund the district; the town later allocates the funds \n\nraised  to  the  utility  district.    Wisconsin  Property  Taxpayers,  Inc.  v.  Town  of \nBuchanan, 2023 WI 58, 408 Wis. 2d 287, 992 N.W.2d 100, 22-1233.\n\n70.05  Valuation  of  property;  assessors  in  cities, \ntowns and villages.  (1)  The assessment of general property \nfor taxation in all the towns, cities and villages of this state shall \nbe made according to this chapter unless otherwise specifically \nprovided.  There shall be elected at the spring election one asses-\nsor for each taxation district not subject to assessment by a county \nassessor  under  s.  70.99  if  election  of  the  assessor  is  provided.   \nCommencing with the 1977 elections and appointments made on \nand after January 1, 1977, no person may assume the office of \ntown, village, city or county assessor unless certified by the de-\npartment  of  revenue  under  s.  73.09  as  qualified  to  perform  the \nfunctions of the office of assessor.  If a person who has not been \nso certified is elected to the office, the office shall be vacant and \nthe appointing authority shall fill the vacancy from a list of per-\nsons so certified by the department of revenue.\n\n(2)  The governing body of any town, city or village not sub-\nject to assessment by a county assessor under s. 70.99 may pro-\nvide for the selection of one or more assistant assessors to assist \nthe assessor in the discharge of the assessor[s duties.\n\n(3)  The  assessment  of  property  of  manufacturing  establish-\nments  subject  to  assessment  under  s.  70.995  shall  be  made  ac-\ncording to that section.\n\n(4)  All assessment personnel, including personnel of a county \nassessor system under s. 70.99, appointed under this section on or \nafter January 1, 1977, shall have passed an examination and have \nbeen certified by the department of revenue as qualified for per-\nforming the functions of the office.\n\n(4m)  A taxation district assessor may not enter upon a per-\nson[s real property for purposes of conducting an assessment un-\nder this chapter more than once in each year, except that an asses-\nsor may enter upon a person[s real property for purposes of con-\nducting an assessment under this chapter more often if the prop-\nerty owner consents.  A property owner may deny entry to an as-\nsessor of the interior of the owner[s residence if the owner has \ngiven prior notice to the assessor that the assessor may not enter \nthe interior of the residence without the property owner[s permis-\nsion.  Each taxation district assessor shall create and maintain a \ndatabase identifying all such property owners in the taxation dis-\ntrict.  A property owner[s refusal to allow the assessor to enter the \ninterior of the owner[s residence shall not preclude the property \nowner from appearing before the board of review to object to the \nproperty[s valuation, as provided under s. 70.47 (7), and the as-\nsessor may not increase the property[s valuation based solely on \nthe property owner[s refusal to allow entry.\n\n(4n)  If a taxation district assessor is requesting to view the in-\nterior of a residence, the assessor shall provide written notice to \nthe property owner of the property owner[s rights regarding the \ninspection  of  the  interior  of  the  owner[s  residence.    The  notice \nshall be in substantially the following form:\n\nPROPERTY OWNER RIGHTS\nYou have the right to refuse entry into your residence pursuant \nto section 70.05 (4m) of the Wisconsin statutes.  Entry to view \nyour property is prohibited unless voluntarily authorized by you.  \nPursuant  to  section  70.05  (4m)  of  the  Wisconsin  statutes,  you \nhave the right to refuse a visual inspection of the interior of your \nresidence and your refusal to allow an interior inspection of your \nresidence will not be used as the sole reason for increasing your \nproperty tax assessment.  Refusing entry to your residence also \ndoes not prohibit you from objecting to your assessment pursuant \nto  section  70.47  (7)  of  the  Wisconsin  statutes.    Please  indicate \nyour consent or refusal to allow an interior visual inspection of \nyour residence.\n\n(5)  (a)  In this subsection:\n\n2023-24 Wisconsin Statutes updated through 2025 Wis.

Before a city, village, or town \nassessor conducts a revaluation of property under this paragraph, \nthe city, village, or town shall publish a notice on its municipal \nwebsite that a revaluation will occur and the approximate dates of \nthe property revaluation.  The notice shall also describe the au-\nthority of an assessor, under ss. 943.13 and 943.15, to enter land.  \nIf  a  municipality  does  not  have  a  website,  it  shall  post  the  re-\nquired information in at least 3 public places within the city, vil-\nlage, or town.\n\n(c)  Annually beginning in 1992, the department of revenue \nshall determine the ratio of the assessed value to the full value of \nall taxable general property and of each major class of property of \neach  taxation  district  and  publish  its  findings  in  the  report  re-\nquired under s. 73.06 (5).\n\n(d)  If the department of revenue determines that the assessed \nvalue of each major class of property of a taxation district, includ-\ning 1st class cities, has not been established within 10 percent of \nthe full value of the same major class of property during the same \nyear at least once during the 4-year period consisting of the cur-\nrent year and the 3 preceding years, the department shall notify \nthe clerk of the taxation district of its intention to proceed under \npar. (f) if the taxation district[s assessed value of each major class \nof  property  for  the  first  year  following  the  4-year  period  is  not \nwithin  10  percent  of  the  full  value  of  the  same  major  class  of \nproperty.  The department[s notice shall be in writing and mailed \nto the clerk of the taxation district on or before November 1 of the \nyear of the determination.\n\n(f)  If, in the first year following the 4-year period under par. \n(d), the department of revenue determines that the assessed value \nof each major class of property of a taxation district, including 1st \nclass cities, has not been established within 10 percent of the full \nvalue of the same major class of property, the department shall \nnotify the clerk of the taxation district in writing on or before No-\nvember 1 of the year of determination of the department[s inten-\ntion  to  proceed  under  par.

That order shall be in writing and shall be \nmailed to the clerk of the taxation district on or before November \n1 of the year of the determination.\n\nHistory:  1973 c. 90; 1975 c. 39, 199; 1979 c. 221; 1981 c. 20; 1983 a. 27; 1985 \na. 332 s. 108; 1987 a. 399; 1989 a. 56; 1991 a. 39, 316; 1995 a. 27, 212; 2003 a. 33; \n2009 a. 68; 2015 a. 322; 2017 a. 68; 2017 a. 365 s. 112; 2023 a. 12.\n\nCompliance  with  the  requirement  of  sub.  (5)  that  property  be  assessed  at  fair \nvalue at least once every five years is not a substitute for compliance with the unifor-\nmity clause and the requirement of s. 70.32 (1) that the property be valued using the \nbest evidence available.

If the governing body of \nany town, village or city not subject to assessment by a county as-\nsessor under s. 70.99 determines that it is in the public interest to \nemploy expert help to aid in making an assessment in order that \nthe assessment may be equitably made in compliance with law, \nthe governing body may employ such necessary help from per-\nsons currently certified by the department of revenue as expert \nappraisers.  If the help so employed is the department of revenue, \nthe department shall designate the persons in its employ responsi-\nble for the assessment.  If the emergency help so employed is a \ncorporation the corporation shall designate the persons in its em-\nploy responsible for the assessment.\n\n(1)  CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.

The department of revenue \nshall  prescribe  standard  specifications  relating  to  assessment \nwork performed by expert appraisers other than the department \nof revenue.  No contract for expert help may be approved by the \ndepartment of revenue unless the contract is submitted on stan-\ndard contract forms prescribed by the department.  If the depart-\nment of revenue acts as the expert help it shall perform the assess-\nment duties in accordance with the standard specifications.\n\n(4)  DUTIES.  When appointed, expert help, together with the \nassessor, shall act together as an assessment board in exercising \nthe  powers  and  duties  of  the  assessor  during  this  employment, \nand the concurrence of a majority of the board is necessary to de-\ntermine any matter upon which they are required to act.

The question is how consequential the use is compared to \nthe total use of the property.  The party seeking the exemption must present more \nthan  XrecollectionsY  and  XobservationsY  of  use.    Deutsches  Land,  Inc.  v.  City  of \nGlendale, 225 Wis. 2d 70, 591 N.W.2d 583 (1999), 96-2489.\n\nThe sub. (4) [now sub.

App. 1999), 98-1264.\n\nIn applying the exempt lessee condition in the section introduction, a housing au-\nthority that subsidized low-income tenants[ rent payments to a benevolent organiza-\ntion property owner cannot be found to be the tenant, which as a governmental en-\ntity would be entitled to property tax exemption.  Under the established legal defini-\ntion of lessee, the lessees are the low-income individuals to whom the benevolent or-\nganization rents.  Columbus Park Housing Corp. v. City of Kenosha, 2003 WI 143, \n267 Wis. 2d 59, 671 N.W.2d 633, 02-0699.\n\nThe standard under Sisters of Saint Mary, 89 Wis. 2d 372 (1979), that properties \nthat are Xreasonably necessaryY to the operation of an exempt use are also exempt is \nrestricted to hospitals subject to sub. (4m).  University of Wisconsin Medical Foun-\ndation, Inc. v. City of Madison, 2003 WI App 204, 267 Wis. 2d 504, 671 N.W.2d \n292, 02-1473.\n\nBenevolent ownership of property is not enough to satisfy sub. (4) [now sub. (4) \n(a)]; benevolent use is also required.  A property owner must detail its use of the \nproperty so that tax assessors know what type of activities, if any, are occurring on \nthe property.  Unsupported opinion testimony and generalized assertions about the \npurportedly benevolent use will not suffice.  University of Wisconsin Medical Foun-\ndation, Inc. v. City of Madison, 2003 WI App 204, 267 Wis. 2d 504, 671 N.W.2d \n292, 02-1473.\n\nAll provision of medical care is not XbenevolentY merely because it makes the re-\ncipients better members of society by improving their physical and mental condi-\ntion.  A benevolent foundation that charged market rates for medical services, adver-\ntised extensively to promote them, and typically forbore collecting for its services \nonly when accounts were deemed uncollectible was not engaged in a benevolent use \nof its clinic properties.  University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation, Inc. v. City of \nMadison, 2003 WI App 204, 267 Wis. 2d 504, 671 N.W.2d 292, 02-1473.\n\nFor a claim under sub. (25) to survive summary judgment, the property owner \nmust establish in the summary judgment record that there is, at a minimum, a factual \ndispute that the main purpose to which the properties were primarily devoted was \none or more of medical research, physician education, or care for destitute individu-\nals.  University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation, Inc. v. City of Madison, 2003 WI \nApp 204, 267 Wis. 2d 504, 671 N.W.2d 292, 02-1473.\n\nXCommercial purposesY as used in sub. (4m) are those through which profits are \nmade.  Even if a property is reasonably necessary to the primary and secondary pur-\nposes of a hospital, a strict but reasonable construction of sub. (4m) indicates that \nproperty fails to qualify for the exemption if it nevertheless is used for a commercial \npurpose.  FH Healthcare Development, Inc. v. City of Wauwatosa, 2004 WI App \n182, 276 Wis. 2d 243, 687 N.W.2d 532, 03-2999.\n\nA hospital seeking tax-exempt status for property under sub. (4m) (a) has the bur-\nden of showing a benefit to the functioning of the hospital, but no burden of showing \nthat the benefit is not otherwise available.  Assuming, without deciding, that partial \nexemptions are allowed, the portion of a hospital[s child care center attributable to \nuse by hospital employees is tax exempt.  Whether the portion attributable to chil-\ndren whose parents are not hospital employees is exempt depends on whether the \nchildren[s parents are reasonably necessary to the efficient functioning of the hospi-\ntal as an organization.  Saint Joseph[s Hospital of Marshfield, Inc. v. City of Marsh-\nfield, 2004 WI App 187, 276 Wis. 2d 574, 688 N.W.2d 658, 03-1006.\n\nThe portion of sub.

Morgan, 2006 WI App 25, 289 Wis. 2d 498, 710 N.W.2d 701, 04-3061.\nRetaining legal title to land does not guarantee that a municipality will remain the \nowner of property for tax exemption purposes.  Taxation or exemption depends not \nupon legal title but on the status of the owner of the beneficial interest in the prop-\nerty.    XOwnedY  in  sub.  (2)  means  beneficial  ownership,  not  mere  technical  title.   \nMilwaukee Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. City of Wauwatosa, 2007 WI 101, 304 \nWis. 2d 53, 735 N.W.2d 156, 05-1160.\n\nThe Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) reasonably relied on nontechnical dictio-\nnary definitions of the computer-related terms in sub. (39).  TAC aptly noted that the \nterms at issue were Xwithin the common lexicon, familiar to most peopleY and that \nthe statute had a Xmore colloquial than technical tone.Y  Based on these observa-\ntions, TAC reasonably concluded that the computer terms at issue were not techni-\ncal, and reasonably applied the general rule of construing the language in accord \nwith its common and approved usage.  Xerox Corp. v. DOR, 2009 WI App 113, 321 \nWis. 2d 181, 772 N.W.2d 677, 07-2884.\n\nThe Tax Appeals Commission[s conclusion that, to be exempt under sub. (39), a \ndevice must be an exempt item under sub. (39) and not merely contain an exempt \nitem was reasonable.  Xerox Corp. v. DOR, 2009 WI App 113, 321 Wis. 2d 181, 772 \nN.W.2d 677, 07-2884.\n\nAn exemption under sub. (4) depends on:  1) whether the residence is owned and \nused exclusively by the church; and 2) whether it is housing for any of four listed cat-\negories of persons, namely, pastors, ordained assistants, members of religious orders \nand communities, or ordained teachers.  The exemption applies to a limited group \nwho are members of a religious group and integral to the functioning of the church.  \nIt is not enough under sub. (4) or Midtown Church of Christ, Inc., 83 Wis. 2d 72 \n(1978), that a custodian[s employment serves the church or is integral to the func-\ntioning  of  the  church.    The  person  must  serve  a  religious  leadership  purpose.   \nWauwatosa Avenue United Methodist Church v. City of Wauwatosa, 2009 WI App \n171, 321 Wis. 2d 796, 776 N.W.2d 280, 09-0202.\n\nIn applying the sub. (4m) (a) exemption for nonprofit hospitals, when an off-site \nfacility is engaged in the primary purpose of a parent hospital the court examines \nonly whether the off-site facility is Xused exclusively for the purposes ofY that hospi-\ntal.  When the circuit court determined that an outpatient clinic effectively served as \na department of the larger parent hospital, the outpatient clinic was used exclusively \nfor the purposes of a hospital and therefore qualified for the exemption under sub. \n\n2023-24 Wisconsin Statutes updated through 2025 Wis.

Factors to be considered are dis-\ncussed.  That a clinic does not provide inpatient services, and that most patients are \nseen by physicians at the clinic by appointment during regular business hours is not \ndeterminative of a Xdoctor[s office.Y  Covenant Healthcare System, Inc. v. City of \nWauwatosa, 2011 WI 80, 336 Wis. 2d 522, 800 N.W.2d 906, 09-1469.\n\nIn the context of not-for-profit entities, the definition of Xcommercial purposesY \nin sub. (4m) (a) is not limited to those purposes that generate profits.  The more ap-\npropriate definition of commercial for the purposes of the not-for-profit hospital ex-\nemption is having profit as the primary aim.  Not-for-profit entities may operate in \nsuch a fashion that generates revenues in excess of expenses.  Covenant Healthcare \nSystem, Inc. v. City of Wauwatosa, 2011 WI 80, 336 Wis. 2d 522, 800 N.W.2d 906, \n09-1469.\n\nUnder the sub. (4m) (a) exemption of hospital property from taxation if Xno part \nof the net earnings . . . inures to the benefit of any shareholder, member, director or \nofficer,Y  the  term  XmemberY  does  not  include  not-for-profit  entities.

City of Wauwatosa, 2011 WI 80, 336 Wis. 2d 522, 800 \nN.W.2d 906, 09-1469.\n\nA nonprofit entity that is Xoperated as a facility that is licensed, certified, or regis-\ntered under ch. 50Y is eligible for the exemption under sub. (4) (a), whether or not \nthe facility is benevolent.  The word Xbenevolent,Y found within the clause Xinclud-\ning benevolent nursing homes,Y clearly modifies Xnursing homesY; it does not mod-\nify Xfacility.Y  Beaver Dam Community Hospitals, Inc. v. City of Beaver Dam, 2012 \nWI App 102, 344 Wis. 2d 278, 822 N.W.2d 491, 11-1479.\n\nThe  purpose,  and  not  the  name  it  is  given,  determines  whether  a  government \ncharge constitutes a tax.  The primary purpose of a tax is to obtain revenue for the \ngovernment, while the primary purpose of a fee is to cover the expense of providing \na service or of regulation and supervision of certain activities.  The test is whether \nthe primary purpose of the charge is to cover the expense of providing services, su-\npervision, or regulation.  Here, the town demonstrated that the primary purpose of a \ncharge was to cover the expense of providing the service of fire protection to the \nproperties  within  its  geographic  boundaries,  and,  therefore,  the  charge  was  a  fee \nrather than a tax and assessable against county property.  Town of Hoard v. Clark \nCounty, 2015 WI App 100, 366 Wis. 2d 239, 873 N.W.2d 241, 15-0678.\n\nTax exemption statutes are strictly construed against granting an exemption.  The \nburden is on the party seeking the exemption to prove its entitlement, and any ambi-\nguity is resolved in favor of taxation.  Although the court applies a strict construc-\ntion, that does not mean that the court need apply the narrowest possible construc-\ntion or an unreasonable construction.  The court, therefore, applies a Xstrict but rea-\nsonableY interpretation to a tax exemption statute.  Southwest Airlines Co. v.

(20), the use of the equipment rather than the primary purpose of \nthe underlying business is the determining factor in deciding whether equipment is \nexempt from taxation.  De minimis uses of the property are not sufficient to invoke \nthis exemption.  Village of Lannon v. Wood-Land Contractors, Inc., 2003 WI 150, \n267 Wis. 2d 158, 672 N.W.2d 275, 02-0236.\n\nSub.

There is no ambiguity in \nthe statutory language such that it might possibly apply to property that is held for \nrental for one month or less and that is also available for rental for more than one \nmonth.

(27) is ambiguous because it does not define the phrase Xused in manufactur-\ning,Y  but  the  legislative  history  surrounding  its  enactment  demonstrates  that  sub. \n(27) was enacted to exempt from taxation only machines, tools, and patterns that are \nreported to local assessors.  The exemption does not apply to machines, tools, and \npatterns that are assessed by the Department of Revenue under s. 70.995.

Such \nplat or record thereof shall be received in evidence in all courts \nand places as correctly describing the several parcels of land or \nland and the buildings, improvements, and fixtures on that land \ntherein designated.  After an assessor[s plat has been made and \nrecorded with the register of deeds as provided by this section, all \nconveyances  of  lands  or  land  and  the  buildings,  improvements, \nand fixtures on that land included in such assessor[s plat shall be \nby  reference  to  such  plat.

The \nmap shall be at a scale of not more than 100 feet per inch, unless \nwaived in writing by the department of administration under s. \n236.20 (2) (L).  The owners of record of lands or the land and the \nbuildings,  improvements,  and  fixtures  on  that  land  in  the  plat \nshall be notified by certified letter mailed to their last-known ad-\ndresses, in order that they shall have opportunity to examine the \nmap, view the temporary monuments, and make known any dis-\nagreement with the boundaries as shown by the temporary monu-\nments.  It is the duty of the professional land surveyor making the \nplat to reconcile any discrepancies that may be revealed so that \nthe plat as certified to the governing body is in conformity with \nthe  records  of  the  register  of  deeds  as  nearly  as  is  practicable.   \nWhen boundary lines between adjacent parcels, as evidenced on \nthe ground, are mutually agreed to in writing by the owners of \nrecord, those lines shall be the true boundaries for all purposes \nthereafter, even though they may vary from the metes and bounds \ndescriptions previously of record.  Such written agreements shall \nbe recorded in the office of the register of deeds.  On every asses-\nsor[s plat, as certified to the governing body, shall appear the doc-\nument number of the record and, if given on the record, the vol-\nume  and  page  where  the  record  is  recorded  for  the  record  that \ncontains  the  metes  and  bounds  description  of  each  parcel,  as \nrecorded  in  the  office  of  the  register  of  deeds,  which  shall  be \nidentified with the number by which such parcel is designated on \nthe plat, except that a lot that has been conveyed or otherwise ac-\nquired but upon which no deed is recorded in the office of regis-\nter  of  deeds  may  be  shown  on  an  assessor[s  plat  and  when  so \nshown shall contain a full metes and bounds description.\n\n(6)  MONUMENTS, PLAT REQUIREMENTS.

Any  stake  or  monument  found \nand accepted as correct by a professional land surveyor laying out \nan assessor[s plat shall be indicated as Xstake foundY or Xmonu-\nment foundY when mapping the plat and such stake or monument \nshall  not  be  removed  or  replaced  even  though  it  is  inconsistent \nwith the standards of s. 236.15.\n\n(7)  CERTIFICATE.  When completed, the assessor[s plat shall \nbe filed with the clerk of the governing body that ordered the plat.  \nOn its title page shall appear the sworn certificate of the profes-\nsional  land  surveyor  who  made  the  plat,  which  shall  state  and \ncontain:\n\n(a)  The name of the governing body by whose order the plat \n\nwas made, and the date of the order.\n\n(b)  A clear and concise description of the land or the land and \n\n2023-24 Wisconsin Statutes updated through 2025 Wis.

At any time within the 30-day \nperiod any person or public body having an interest in any lands \naffected by the plat may bring a suit to have the plat corrected.  If \nno suit is brought within the 30-day period, the plat may be ap-\nproved by the governing body, and filed for record.  If a suit is \nbrought, approval shall be withheld until the suit is decided.  The \nplat shall then be revised in accordance with the decision if nec-\nessary, and, without rereferral to the department of administra-\ntion unless rereferral is ordered by the court.  The plat may then \nbe approved by the governing body and filed for record.  When so \nfiled the plat shall carry on its face the certificate of the clerk that \nall  provisions  of  this  section  have  been  complied  with.    When \nrecorded after approval by the governing body, the plat shall have \nthe same effect for all purposes as if it were a land division plat \nmade by the owners in full compliance with ch. 236.

XAgricultural forest landY means land that is producing \nor is capable of producing commercial forest products, if the land \nsatisfies any of the following conditions:\n\na.    It  is  contiguous  to  a  parcel  that  has  been  classified  in \nwhole as agricultural land under this subsection, if the contigu-\nous parcel is owned by the same person that owns the land that is \nproducing or is capable of producing commercial forest products.  \nIn  this  subdivision,  XcontiguousY  includes  separated  only  by  a \nroad.\n\nb.  It is located on a parcel that contains land that is classified \nas agricultural land in the property tax assessment on January 1, \n2004, and on January 1 of the year of assessment.\n\nc.  It is located on a parcel at least 50 percent of which, by \nacreage,  was  converted  to  land  that  is  classified  as  agricultural \nland  in  the  property  tax  assessment  on  January  1,  2005,  or \nthereafter.\n\n1g.   XAgricultural landY means land, exclusive of buildings \nand improvements and the land necessary for their location and \nconvenience, that is devoted primarily to agricultural use.\n\n1i.  XAgricultural useY means agricultural use as defined by \nthe department of revenue by rule and includes the  growing of \nshort rotation woody crops, including poplars and willows, using \nagronomic practices.\n\n1k.  XAgronomic practicesY means agricultural practices gen-\nerally associated with field crop production, including soil man-\nagement, cultivation, and row cropping.\n\n1m.  XOther,Y as it relates to par.

Tax 18, Wis. adm. code.\nWhen market value is established by a fair sale of the property or sales of reason-\nably comparable property are available, it is error for an assessor to resort to other \nfactors to determine fair market value, although such factors in the absence of such \nsales would have a bearing on market value.  Rules on judicial review of valuation \npresuppose that the method of evaluation is in accordance with the statutes; hence \nerrors of law should be corrected by the court on certiorari and the failure to make \nan assessment on the statutory basis is an error of law.  State ex rel. Markarian v. \nCity of Cudahy, 45 Wis. 2d 683, 173 N.W.2d 627 (1970).\n\nWhile a sale establishes value, the assessment still has to be equal to that on com-\nparable property.  Sub. (2) requires the assessor to fix a value before classifying the \nland; it does not prohibit the assessor from considering the zoning of the property \nwhen it is used for some other purpose.  State ex rel. Hensel v. Town of Wilson, 55 \nWis. 2d 101, 197 N.W.2d 794 (1972).\n\nIn making an assessment based on a recent sale of the property, the assessor can-\nnot increase the value because no commission was paid to a broker.  State ex rel. \nLincoln Fireproof Warehouse Co. v. Board of Review, 60 Wis. 2d 84, 208 N.W.2d \n380 (1973).\n\nUnder an option agreement, the sellers[ right to repurchase their homestead and \ntheir right of first refusal for the purchase of industrial buildings to be constructed \non the property were factors going only to the willingness of the parties to deal, not \ntheir  compulsion  to  do  so;  the  value  of  these  rights,  together  with  the  monetary \namount per acre, comprised the total sale price of the land.  State ex rel. Geipel v. \nCity of Milwaukee, 68 Wis. 2d 726, 229 N.W.2d 585 (1975).\n\nEvidence  of  net  income  from  unique  property  was  admissible  to  show  market \nvalue.  An assessor[s unconfirmed valuation based on estimated replacement cost \nless depreciation could not stand alone because of uncontroverted evidence of actual \ncosts  of  recent  construction.    Rosen  v.  City  of  Milwaukee,  72  Wis.  2d  653,  242 \nN.W.2d 681 (1976).\n\nWhen there are no actual sales, cost, depreciation, replacement value, income, in-\ndustrial conditions, location and occupancy, sales of like property, book value, in-\nsurance carried, value asserted in a prospectus, and appraisals are all relevant to de-\ntermination of market value for assessment purposes.  State ex rel. Mitchell Aero, \nInc. v. Board of Review, 74 Wis. 2d 268, 246 N.W.2d 521 (1976).\n\nDistrict-wide use of comparative sales statistics to determine annual percentage \nincreases of assessments was invalid under sub. (1).  State ex rel. Kaskin v. Board of \nReview, 91 Wis. 2d 272, 282 N.W.2d 620 (Ct. App. 1979).  See also Lloyd v. Board \nof Review, 179 Wis. 2d 33, 505 N.W.2d 465 (Ct.

Robertson, 99 \nWis. 2d 561, 299 N.W.2d 626 (Ct. App. 1980).\n\nThe lease of comparable property constituted the Xbest informationY regarding \nfair market value of leasehold improvements.  State ex rel. Keane v. Board of Re-\nview, 99 Wis. 2d 584, 299 N.W.2d 638 (Ct. App. 1980).\n\nSub. (1) requires the use of a cash equivalency adjustment in assessing property \nbased upon the sale of comparable properties.  State ex rel. Flint Building Co. v. \nKenosha  County  Board  of  Review,  126  Wis.  2d  152,  376  N.W.2d  364  (Ct.  App. \n1985).\n\nAn assessment largely based upon consideration of equalized value was invalid.  \nThe court erred by remanding with the requirement that a new assessment consider \nthe actual subsequent sale of the subject property.  State ex rel. Kesselman v. Board \nof Review, 133 Wis. 2d 122, 394 N.W.2d 745 (Ct. App. 1986).\n\nThe board of review erred as a matter of law by basing an assessment on XmarketY \nrental income when there was a recent arms-length sale of the property.  Darcel, Inc. \nv. City of Manitowoc Board of Review, 137 Wis. 2d 623, 405 N.W.2d 344 (1987).\n\nIn determining market value under sub. (1), the board of review must determine \nwhether financing arrangements between the seller and buyer affected the sale price; \nsub. (1) prohibits assessment exceeding market value.  Flood v. Village of Lomira, \n153 Wis. 2d 428, 451 N.W.2d 422 (1990).\n\nA tax assessment under sub. (1) may include as a component of value the prop-\nerty[s transferable income-producing capacity that is reflected by a recent sale.  The \nkey of the analysis is whether the value is appended to the property and is thus trans-\nferable with the property or whether it is, in effect, independent of the property so \nthat the value either stays with the seller or dissipates upon sale.  In this case, a shop-\nping mall[s reason for existence—namely, the leasing of space to tenants and related \nactivities such as trash disposal, baby stroller rentals, etc.—was a transferable value \nthat was inextricably intertwined with the land, just as the transferable value of a \nfarm—the  growing  of  crops—is  inextricably  intertwined  with  the  property  from \nwhich the farm operates.  State ex rel. N/S Associates v. Board of Review, 164 Wis. \n2d 31, 473 N.W.2d 554 (Ct. App. 1991).\n\nThis section establishes a unitary taxing scheme; mineral rights are taxed as an el-\nement of the real estate and not separately.  Cornell University v. Rusk County, 166 \nWis. 2d 811, 481 N.W.2d 485 (Ct. App. 1992).\n\nThe capitalization of income method, based on estimated market rents rather than \non  actual  rent,  was  an  improper  method  of  assessing  subsidized  rental  property.   \nMetropolitan Holding Co. v. Board of Review, 173 Wis. 2d 626, 495 N.W.2d 314 \n(1993).\n\nCompliance with the s. 73.03 (2a) assessment manual is not a defense when the \nmethod of assessment violates sub. (1).  Metropolitan Holding Co. v. Board of Re-\nview, 173 Wis. 2d 626, 495 N.W.2d 314 (1993).\n\nWhen an assessor disavows the correctness of a valuation of comparable property \n\n2023-24 Wisconsin Statutes updated through 2025 Wis.

The taxpayer has the burden of proof on each assessment \nmanual condition that must be met.  Doneff v. City of Two Rivers Board of Review, \n184 Wis. 2d 203, 516 N.W.2d 383 (1994).\n\nThe use of owner-operator income to value property is allowed if the net income \nreflects the property[s chief source of value, the income is produced without skill of \nthe owner, or the owner[s skill and labor are factored out and other valuation ap-\nproaches are considered.  Waste Management of Wisconsin, Inc. v. Kenosha County \nBoard of Review, 184 Wis. 2d 541, 516 N.W.2d 695 (1994).\n\nThere is no bright line rule for the number of comparable properties that must be \nshown to prove that the rule of uniformity is being violated.  Assessments that are \ndiscriminatory  and  made  based  on  arbitrary  and  improper  considerations  cannot \nstand.  State ex rel. Levine v. Board of Review, 191 Wis. 2d 363, 528 N.W.2d 424 \n(1995).\n\nProperty that is encumbered by a bundle of rights must be appraised at its value \nusing the current value of that bundle of rights.  City of West Bend v. Continental IV \nFund Ltd. Partnership, 193 Wis. 2d 481, 535 N.W.2d 24 (Ct. App. 1995).\n\nReal property shall be valued based on the best information available.  The best \ninformation is a recent arms-length sale of the property, followed by recent sales of \ncomparable property.  If either of those are not available, the assessor may look to all \nfactors that collectively have a bearing on the value of the property.  State ex rel. \nCampbell  v.  Township  of  Delavan,  210  Wis.  2d  239,  565  N.W.2d  209  (Ct.  App. \n1997), 96-1291.\n\nEqualized value is not a measure of fair market value of individual properties; it is \nimproper  for  an  assessor  to  take  it  into  account  in  valuing  property.    Noah[s  Ark \nFamily Park v. Board of Review, 210 Wis. 2d 301, 565 N.W.2d 230 (Ct.

The \nburden of taxation must be borne as nearly as practicable among all property, based \non value.  Compliance with the requirement of s. 70.05 (5) that property be assessed \nat fair value at least once every five years is not a substitute for compliance with the \nuniformity  clause  and  sub.  (1).    Approving  an  increased  assessment  for  only  one \nproperty  despite  evidence  that  it  and  other  properties  had  recent  sales  at  a  price \nabove prior assessments violated the law, and its approval by the board of review \nwas arbitrary.  Noah[s Ark Family Park v. Board of Review, 210 Wis. 2d 301, 565 \nN.W.2d 230 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-1074.\nAffirmed.  216 Wis. 2d 387, 573 N.W.2d 852 (1998), 96-1074.\n\nIt was improper to rely solely on insurance replacement value to set the valuation \nof low income apartments encumbered with income and rental restrictions, although \nit was a relevant factor.  Walworth Affordable Housing, LLC v. Village of Walworth, \n229 Wis. 2d 797, 601 N.W.2d 325 (Ct. App. 1999), 98-2535.\n\nIncome that is attributable to land, rather than personal to the owner, is inextrica-\nbly intertwined with the land and is transferable to future owners.  This income may \nbe included in the land[s assessment because it appertains to the land.  Income from \nmanaging separate off-site property may be inextricably intertwined with land and \nsubject to assessment if the income is generated primarily on the assessed property \nitself.  ABKA Ltd. Partnership v. Board of Review, 231 Wis. 2d 328, 603 N.W.2d \n217 (1999), 98-0851.\n\nThe requirement to use the Xbest informationY does not require that an assessor \nuse actual figures in the absence of a sale.  An assessor acted properly in using esti-\nmated expense figures when actual figures did not reflect regular expenses.  ABKA \nLtd. Partnership v. Board of Review, 231 Wis. 2d 328, 603 N.W.2d 217 (1999), 98-\n0851.\n\nIt is clear from the Property Assessment Manual that assessors should consider \nmany market factors from a variety of sources when gathering and applying compa-\nrable sales information.  Even sales prices of similar properties need some adjust-\nment in order to arrive at an estimate of value for a different property.  Joyce v. Town \nof Tainter, 2000 WI App 15, 232 Wis. 2d 349, 606 N.W.2d 284, 99-0324.\n\nWhen valuing subsidized housing, assessors are required to consider the effects \nthe property[s restrictions have on value.  Bloomer Housing Ltd. Partnership v. City \nof Bloomer, 2002 WI App 252, 257 Wis. 2d 883, 653 N.W.2d 309, 01-3495.  See \nalso Northland Whitehall Apartments Ltd. Partnership v.

If the use of a market rate was proper in City of Bloomer, 2002 WI \nApp 252, the use of a subsidized interest rate cannot be.  Mineral Point Valley Ltd. \nPartnership v. City of Mineral Point Board of Review, 2004 WI App 158, 275 Wis. \n2d 784, 686 N.W.2d 697, 03-1857.\n\nA property tax assessment of retail property leased at above-market rent values \nshould be based on market rents and not on the above-market rental terms of the ac-\ntual lease.  Walgreen Co. v. City of Madison, 2008 WI 80, 311 Wis. 2d 158, 752 \nN.W.2d 687, 06-1859.\n\nWhen an assessor only after looking at prevailing market conditions and all vari-\nables determined that the market for lakefront property had grown so strong that fac-\ntors other than beach length and beach quality were being ignored by the market-\nplace, the approach was not formulaic and was not in violation of Campbell, 210 \nWis. 2d 239 (1997).  Anic v. Board of Review, 2008 WI App 71, 311 Wis. 2d 701, \n751 N.W.2d 870, 07-0761.\n\nAn assessment based on a Department of Revenue analysis of the sale of a mining \ncompany that owned the land was not based upon a recent arm[s-length sale of the \nproperty.  A value derived by analyzing a complex corporate transaction involving \nthe sale of a variety of assets, tangible and intangible, independent and interdepen-\ndent, is not equivalent to the price obtained in a sale of one component of that trans-\naction.  Forest County Potawatomi Community v. Township of Lincoln, 2008 WI \nApp 156, 314 Wis. 2d 363, 761 N.W.2d 31, 07-2523.\n\nThe Property Assessment Manual and case law set forth a three-tier system for \n\ndetermining  the  fair  market  value  of  property.    A  recent  arm[s-length  sale  of  the \nproperty is the best evidence of value and is the basis for an assessment under tier \none.  If there has been no recent sale, an assessor must consider sales of reasonably \ncomparable properties, which is the tier two approach.  In the absence of compara-\nble sales data, the assessor determines the value under tier three, which permits con-\nsideration of all the factors collectively that have a bearing on value of the property \nin order to determine its fair market value.  Nestle USA, Inc. v. DOR, 2009 WI App \n159, 322 Wis. 2d 156, 776 N.W.2d 589, 08-0322.\nAffirmed.  2011 WI 4, 331 Wis. 2d 256, 795 N.W.2d 46, 08-0322.\n\nAbsent sufficient proof that no market existed for a property having a specialized \nuse, an assessment under the tier two comparable sales approach based on an ex-\npanded definition of highest and best use to include a use for which a market exists \nwould be contrary to sub. (1).  The taxpayer has the burden of proving the absence of \na market for the property with its current specialized use.  That there were no known \nsales of properties put to that special use merely suggests that such properties are \nrarely bought and sold.  It does not necessarily indicate that the taxpayer would be \nunable to find a buyer who intended to maintain the property as its current use.  Nes-\ntle USA, Inc. v. DOR, 2009 WI App 159, 322 Wis. 2d 156, 776 N.W.2d 589, 08-\n0322.\nAffirmed.  2011 WI 4, 331 Wis. 2d 256, 795 N.W.2d 46, 08-0322.\n\nWhen there are no sales of the property itself or of reasonably comparable proper-\nties, an assessment cannot be made under a tier one or tier two methodology.  The \nassessment is then made using a tier three methodology.  The cost of replacement \napproach is the preferred tier three method of valuation when, as here, the property \nhas a highly specialized use resulting in there being no comparable properties.  Nes-\ntle USA, Inc. v. DOR, 2009 WI App 159, 322 Wis. 2d 156, 776 N.W.2d 589, 08-\n0322.\nAffirmed.  2011 WI 4, 331 Wis. 2d 256, 795 N.W.2d 46, 08-0322.\n\nIn situations when it has been determined that there is no potential market for the \nsubject property, it is contrary to sub. (1) to conclude that the highest and best use of \nthe property should remain the same.  That was not the case when there was at least \na limited market for powdered infant formula production facilities.  Nestle USA, Inc. \nv. DOR, 2011 WI 4, 331 Wis. 2d 256, 795 N.W.2d 46, 08-0322.\n\nReassessing one property at a significantly higher rate than comparable properties \nusing a different methodology and then declining to reassess the comparable proper-\nties by that methodology violates the uniformity clause.  U.S. Oil Co. v. City of Mil-\nwaukee, 2011 WI App 4, 331 Wis. 2d 407, 794 N.W.2d 904, 09-2260.\n\nComparing a taxpayer[s appraised value to lower values assigned to a relatively \nsmall number of other properties has long been rejected as a claimed violation of the \nuniformity clause.  Lack of uniformity must be established by showing a general un-\ndervaluation of properties within a district when the subject property has been as-\nsessed at full market value.  Great Lakes Quick Lube, LP v. City of Milwaukee, 2011 \nWI App 7, 331 Wis. 2d 137, 794 N.W.2d 510, 09-2775.\n\nA property[s assessed value is based on fair market value, but a property[s as-\nsessed value is not necessarily equal to its fair market value.  Assessors must base as-\nsessments of real property on the property[s fair market value.  However, as the plain \nlanguage of the Property Assessment Manual makes clear, a property[s fair market \nvalue is not synonymous with its assessed value.  In most cases, individual property \nassessments are different than the property[s fair market value.  State ex rel. Stupar \nRiver LLC v. Town of Linwood Board of Review, 2011 WI 82, 336 Wis. 2d 562, 800 \nN.W.2d 468, 09-0191.\n\nThe taxpayer challenging an assessment and classification has the burden of prov-\ning at the board hearing that the assessment and classification of property are erro-\nneous; that the taxpayer did not meet the burden of proof; and that the board[s deter-\nmination to maintain the assessment is supported by a reasonable view of the evi-\ndence.  Sausen v. Town of Black Creek Board of Review, 2014 WI 9, 352 Wis. 2d \n576, 843 N.W.2d 39, 10-3015.\n\nExcept for sub. (2) (c) 3., every subdivision of sub. (2) (c) uses the verb XmeansY \ninstead of XincludesY when defining a property classification.  XMeansY clearly lim-\nits the classes of property defined in those subdivisions to the specific types of prop-\nerty  described  therein.    If  the  legislature  intended  the  residential  class  to  be  re-\nstricted to the type of property described in sub. (2) (c) 3., it would have used the \nverb XmeansY instead of Xincludes.Y  Aside from the property specifically described \nin sub. (2) (c) 3., any other property included in the residential class must fall within \nthe ordinary meaning of the term Xresidential.Y  West Capitol, Inc. v. Village of Sis-\nter Bay, 2014 WI App 52, 354 Wis. 2d 130, 848 N.W.2d 875, 13-1458.\n\nNothing in s. 70.10 requires a property to be classified based on its actual use or \nprevents an assessor from considering a property[s most likely use.  An owner[s sub-\njective expression of intent is not dispositive of a property[s most likely use.  The \nProperty  Assessment  Manual  directs  assessors  to  consider  whether  the  property \nowner[s actions are consistent with an intent for residential use, but that is only one \nof seven factors the manual directs assessors to consider.

Regency West Apartments LLC v. City of Racine, 2016 WI 99, 372 Wis. \n2d 282, 888 N.W.2d 611, 14-2947.\n\nSub. (1) requires assessors to value property based on Xthe best information that \nthe assessor can practicably obtain.Y  In this case, projected expenses and income for \nthe newly opened property were available to the assessor.  When the assessor calcu-\nlated  the  net  operating  income  for  an  income-based  valuation  through  mass  ap-\npraisal techniques that were not particularized to the assessed property, the assess-\nment did not comply with sub. (1) because it did not use the Xbest informationY that \nwas available.  Regency West Apartments LLC v. City of Racine, 2016 WI 99, 372 \nWis. 2d 282, 888 N.W.2d 611, 14-2947.\n\nIn addition to calculating a net operating income (NOI) for the subject property, \nan income-based valuation requires determining the applicable capitalization rate.  \nThe capitalization rate expresses the rate of return an investor would expect to re-\nceive from an investment in the subject property.  The value of a subject property is \ndetermined by dividing its NOI by the applicable capitalization rate.  Capitalization \nrates from the marketplace are usually derived from the sale of market-rate projects.  \nSuch capitalization rates do not reflect the unique characteristics of subsidized hous-\ning.  Regency West Apartments LLC v.

The Property Assessment Manual explicitly states that when subsi-\ndized properties are reasonably comparable, properties being compared must have \nrestrictions similar to the subject property.  To determine if properties have similar \nrestrictions, an appraiser must examine the specific restrictions that apply to each \nproperty, as well as the differences between these restrictions.  Regency West Apart-\nments LLC v. City of Racine, 2016 WI 99, 372 Wis. 2d 282, 888 N.W.2d 611, 14-\n2947.\n\nSub. (1) explicitly directs that property be assessed in the manner specified in the \nProperty Assessment Manual Xfrom actual view or from the best information that \nthe assessor can practicably obtain.Y  The manual provides that commercial prop-\nerty can be valued by either single property or mass appraisal techniques.  The man-\nual makes clear that mass appraisal is accepted at the initial assessment stage and \nsets forth when a single property appraisal is necessary after the initial mass ap-\npraisal has been challenged by the taxpayer or if the property being valued is a spe-\ncial-purpose property that does not lend itself well to mass appraisal.  The express \nlanguage of the manual indicates that mass appraisal is a proper method of valuation \nin all other circumstances.  Metropolitan Associates v.

When the property owner adamantly denied any \nfarming took place at all on the land and insisted that the property owner was main-\ntaining ground cover only, the property owner failed to present any evidence that the \nuse  qualified  as  agricultural  for  tax  assessment  purposes.

(1m) requires that an assessor consider the impairment of the value of prop-\nerty due to contamination.  In this case, the assessor determined that, given the prop-\nerty[s location and taking into account the presence of contamination, the highest \nand best use in its current state was a parking lot.  By utilizing the income approach \nto value the property according to its highest and best use as a parking lot, the asses-\nsor properly considered the impairment of the value of the property due to contami-\nnation in arriving at a valuation pursuant to sub. (1m).  The property owner argued \nthat, because the property was contaminated, the owner could not sell it, and that ac-\ncordingly the assessed value should be zero dollars.  However, the assessment recog-\nnized that the highest and best use of the property as a parking lot had value to the \nowner even if the cost to cure environmental problems exceeded the value of the \nproperty.  State ex rel. Collison v. City of Milwaukee Board of Review, 2021 WI 48, \n397 Wis. 2d 246, 960 N.W.2d 1, 18-0669.\n\nSome agricultural use—even if it is the only XuseY the land is put to—does not \nmean the land is Xdevoted primarily to agricultural use.Y  XDevoted primarilyY is the \nkey phrase here.  Being XdevotedY to something means to be given over to and com-\nmitted to that thing, and XprimarilyY means chiefly or mainly.  As a matter of plain \nEnglish, an agricultural classification is only proper if the land is chiefly given over \nto agricultural use.  State ex rel. Nudo Holdings, LLC v.

The comparability of vacant properties to occupied properties \nexists along a continuum depending upon how long the property has been vacant as \ncompared to the normal exposure time for a property of that type in the same geo-\ngraphic area.  The manual urges assessors to use caution in utilizing such compara-\nbles, as the economics underlying a vacancy may be indicative of a meaningful dif-\nference in the circumstances of the properties.  Lowe[s Home Centers, LLC v. City \nof Delavan, 2023 WI 8, 405 Wis. 2d 616, 985 N.W.2d 69, 19-1987.\n\nWalgreen Co., 2008 WI 80, does not stand for the blanket proposition that occu-\npancy or vacancy has no role to play in valuation.  Many factors inform the value of \nland, including the land[s viability to house a business.  Generally, a site that can \nsustain a business is more valuable than one that cannot.  Further, a dark property is \nmore likely to have characteristics that would make it less valuable than a property \nthat was on the market for a shorter period of time.  Real estate must be valued at its \nhighest and best use.  Lowe[s Home Centers, LLC v. City of Delavan, 2023 WI 8, \n405 Wis. 2d 616, 985 N.W.2d 69, 19-1987.\n\nTo account for vacancy under the income approach for a brand new building that \nis in the process of lease-up, anticipated leases are financial factors affecting the cur-\nrent value of the property and are properly considered.  The reasonable anticipation \nof additional leases occurring in the lease-up period is a factor that is applicable on \nJanuary 1, even if the leases themselves are not signed until after that date.

If the court determines that the value does not \nrepresent  a  reasonable  apportionment,  the  court  shall  redeter-\nmine the parcels[ values, the total of which shall equal the valua-\ntion of the original undivided parcel on January 1 of that year.\n\n(3)  LIEN  EXTINGUISHED.

The notice shall contain \nthe  amount  of  the  changed  assessment  and  the  time,  date,  and \nplace of the meeting of the local board of review or of the board \nof assessors.  The notice shall also include the following: XUnder \nWisconsin law, generally, the assessor may not change the assess-\nment of property based solely on the recent arm[s length sale of \nthe property without adjusting the assessed value of comparable \nproperties in the same market area.  For information on the as-\nsessment of properties that have recently sold, visit the Internet \nsite of the Department of Revenue at ...

The  assessor  shall  attach  to  the  assessment  roll  a \nstatement  that  the  notices  required  by  this  section  have  been \nmailed and failure to receive the notice shall not affect the valid-\nity of the changed assessment, the resulting changed tax, the pro-\ncedures of the board of review or of the board of assessors or the \nenforcement  of  delinquent  taxes  by  statutory  means.    After  the \nperson assessed or the occupant of the property receives notice \nunder this section, if the assessor changes the assessment as a re-\nsult of the examination of the rolls as provided in s. 70.45 and the \nperson assessed waives, in writing and on a form prescribed or \napproved by the department of revenue, the person[s right to the \nnotice of the changed assessment under this section, no additional \nnotice is required under this section.  The secretary of revenue \nshall prescribe the form of the notice required under this section.  \nThe form shall include information notifying the taxpayer of the \nprocedures to be used to object to the assessment.

Under this section, a notice of assessment is required only when the prop-\nerty[s assessed value has changed.  After reading these statutes, it should have been \nclear to the taxpayer that:  1) because it did not receive a notice of assessment, its \nproperty[s assessed value for 2011 would be unchanged from 2010; and 2) if the tax-\npayer wanted to challenge the 2011 assessment, it needed to object before the board \nof review.

(1)  LEG-\nISLATIVE FINDINGS.  The legislature finds that:\n\n(a)    The  existence  has  been  announced  of  several  economi-\ncally significant ore bodies containing copper, zinc, lead, taconite \nand other metalliferous minerals in this state, including one of the \nlargest zinc deposits in North America.\n\n(b)  Metalliferous minerals are valuable, irreplaceable natural \nresources which, once removed, are forever lost as an economic \nasset to the state.\n\n(c)  The activity of mining metalliferous minerals creates jobs, \neconomic activity, tax revenues and other valuable benefits to the \neconomy and residents of this state.\n\n(d)  The activity of mining metalliferous minerals creates ad-\nditional costs to the state and municipalities for highways, sewers, \nschools and other improvements which are necessary to accom-\nmodate the development of a metalliferous mining industry.\n\n(e)  The activity of mining metalliferous minerals has a perma-\n\nnent and often damaging effect on the environment of the state.\n\n(f)  The activity of mining metalliferous minerals significantly \nalters  the  quality  of  life  in  communities  directly  affected  by \nmining.\n\n(g)  As the size of a mining operation increases, the cost to the \nstate  and  municipalities  to  support  the  operation  increases,  as \ndoes the damage to the environment.  Furthermore, as the size of \na  mining  operation  increases,  the  person  mining  metalliferous \nminerals  benefits  from  economies  of  scale  in  the  mining \noperation.\n\n(h)  A graduated net proceeds occupational tax, by taxing prof-\nitability at rates which vary with the level of profitability, encour-\nages important state goals, such as:\n\n1.  Gradual, continuous and complete extraction of metallif-\n\nerous minerals.\n\n2.  Continued stable employment.\n3.  Taxation according to ability to pay.\n4.  Taxation based on the privileges enjoyed by persons min-\n\ning metalliferous metallic minerals.\n\n(i)  Municipalities incur long-term economic costs as a result \nof metalliferous mineral mining after the mining operation shuts \ndown.  An impact fund, in which is deposited a portion of the tax \nrevenues, should assure that moneys will be available to such mu-\nnicipalities for long- and short-term costs associated with social, \neducational, environmental and economic impacts of metallifer-\nous mineral mining.\n\n(2)  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the declared intent of the legis-\nlature to establish a net proceeds occupation tax on persons en-\ngaged  in  the  activity  of  mining  metalliferous  minerals  in  this \nstate.  The tax is established in order that the state may derive a \nbenefit from the extraction of irreplaceable metalliferous miner-\nals  and  in  order  to  compensate  the  state  and  municipalities  for \ncosts, past, present and future, incurred or to be incurred as a re-\nsult  of  the  loss  of  valuable  irreplaceable  metallic  mineral \nresources.\n\nHistory:  1977 c. 31.\n\n70.375  Net  proceeds  occupation  tax  on  mining  of \nmetallic minerals; computation.

(12).    The  action  shall  be  given \npreference.  If the court on the appeal finds any error in the pro-\nceedings of the board which renders the assessment or the pro-\nceedings void, it shall remand the assessment to the board for fur-\nther  proceedings  in  accordance  with  the  court[s  determination \nand  retain  jurisdiction  of  the  matter  until  the  board  has  deter-\nmined an assessment in accordance with the court[s order.  For \nthis purpose, if final adjournment of the board occurs prior to the \ncourt[s decision on the appeal, the court may order the governing \nbody of the assessing authority to reconvene the board.\n\n(14)  TAX PAYMENTS.  In the event the board of review has not \ncompleted its review or heard an objection to an assessment on \nreal  or  personal  property  prior  to  the  date  the  taxes  predicated \nupon such assessment are due, or in the event there is an appeal as \nprovided  in  sub.

(a)  In 1st class cities all objections to the amount or val-\nuation of real or personal property shall be first made in writing \nand filed with the commissioner of assessments on or before the \n3rd Monday in May.  No person may, in any action or proceeding, \nquestion the amount or valuation of real or personal property in \nthe  assessment  rolls  of  the  city  unless  objections  have  been  so \nfiled.  The board may not waive the requirement that objections \nbe in writing.  Persons who own land and improvements to that \nland may object to the aggregate valuation of that land and im-\nprovements to that land, but no person who owns land and im-\nprovements to that land may object only to the valuation of that \nland or only to the valuation of improvements to that land.  If the \nobjections have been investigated by a committee of the board of \nassessors under s. 70.07 (6), the board of review may adopt the \nrecommendation of the committee unless the objector requests or \nthe  board  orders  a  hearing.    At  least  2  days[  notice  of  the  time \nfixed for the hearing shall be given to the objector or attorney and \nto the city attorney of the city.  The provisions of the statutes re-\nlating  to  boards  of  review  not  inconsistent  with  this  subsection \napply  to  proceedings  before  the  boards  of  review  of  1st  class \ncities, except that the board need not adjourn until the assessment \nroll  is  completed  by  the  commissioner  of  assessments,  as  re-\nquired in s. 70.07 (6), but may immediately hold hearings on ob-\njections  filed  with  the  commissioner  of  assessments,  and  the \nchanges, corrections and determinations made by the board act-\ning within its powers shall be prima facie correct.  Appeal from \nthe determination shall be by an action for certiorari commenced \nwithin 90 days after the taxpayer receives the notice under sub. \n(12).  The action shall be given preference.\n\n(b)    In  1st  class  cities  if  an  assessment  valuation  for  taxes \nbased on the value of real property is the same for the current year \nas  for  the  preceding  year  and  ownership  of  the  property  is  un-\nchanged, and if an objection had been filed to the assessment val-\nuation for the preceding year and the assessed valuation by the as-\nsessor was sustained by the board of review or the courts, an ob-\njection  filed  under  sub.  (7)  to  the  assessment  valuation  on  the \n\nsame property for the current year shall be subject to a fee not to \nexceed $10 payable to the city at the time of filing the objection \nor within 3 days thereafter, and the fee shall be a condition for the \nhearing of the objection before the board of review.\n\n(17)  SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS.

[Bill 613-A]\n\nA board of review may deny a taxpayer a hearing if the taxpayer[s objections are \nnot stated on an approved form; the board is not required to accept information sub-\nmitted in a different form.  Certiorari review under this section is limited to the ac-\ntion of the board.  Bitters v. Town of Newbold, 51 Wis. 2d 493, 187 N.W.2d 339 \n(1971).\n\nBoard of review consideration of testimony by the village assessor at an executive \nsession subsequent to the presentation of evidence by the taxpayer was contrary to \nthe open meeting law, s. 66.77 [now ss. 19.81 to 19.98].  Although it was permissi-\nble for the board to convene a closed session for the purpose of deliberating after a \nquasi-judicial  hearing,  the  proceedings  did  not  constitute  mere  deliberations  but \nwere a continuation of the hearing without the presence of or notice to the objecting \ntaxpayer.  Dolphin v. Board of Review, 70 Wis. 2d 403, 234 N.W.2d 277 (1975).\n\nA circuit court[s retained jurisdiction in board of review certiorari actions under \nsub. (13) does not affect the finality of an order for appeal purposes.  Steenberg v. \nTown of Oakfield, 157 Wis. 2d 674, 461 N.W.2d 148 (Ct. App. 1990).\n\nOn certiorari review of a board of review decision only whether the board acted:  \n\n1) within its jurisdiction; 2) according to law; 3) arbitrarily, oppressively, or unrea-\nsonably; or 4) without evidence to make the order or determination in question is \nconsidered.  Metropolitan Holding Co. v. Board of Review, 173 Wis. 2d 626, 495 \nN.W.2d 314 (1993).\n\nWhen  a  board  of  review  disregards  uncontroverted  evidence,  its  determination \nmust be set aside.  State ex rel. Campbell v. Township of Delavan, 210 Wis. 2d 239, \n565 N.W.2d 209 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-1291.\n\nApproving an increased assessment for only one property, despite evidence that it \nand other properties had recent sales at a price above prior assessments, violated the \nlaw; its approval by the board of review was arbitrary.  Noah[s Ark Family Park v. \nBoard of Review, 210 Wis. 2d 301, 565 N.W.2d 230 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-1074.\nAffirmed.  216 Wis. 2d 387, 573 N.W.2d 852 (1998), 96-1074.\n\nA board of review[s across the board three percent assessment reduction of all lots \nin a developer[s subdivision was not arbitrary and capricious when the board was \npresented with conflicting credible evidence.  Whitecaps Homes, Inc. v. Kenosha \nCounty Board of Review, 212 Wis. 2d 714, 569 N.W.2d 714 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-\n1913.\n\nSub. (13) and ss. 70.85 and 74.37 provide the exclusive methods to challenge a \nmunicipality[s bases for assessment of individual parcels.  All require appeal to the \nboard of review prior to court action.  There is no alternative procedure to challenge \nan assessment[s compliance with the uniformity clause.  Hermann v. Town of Dela-\nvan, 215 Wis. 2d 370, 572 N.W.2d 855 (1998), 96-0171.\n\nIt was not improper for an assessor to testify as a witness and also to ask questions \nof other witnesses at a board of review hearing.  Rite-Hite Corp. v. Board of Review, \n216 Wis. 2d 189, 575 N.W.2d 721 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-3178.\n\nA landowner who has in the immediately previous year already objected to the \nboard of review regarding an unchanged assessment is relieved from filing another \nobjection to the current assessment prior to commencing an action.  Duesterbeck v. \nTown of Koshkonong, 2000 WI App 6, 232 Wis. 2d 16, 605 N.W.2d 904, 98-3048.\n\n2023-24 Wisconsin Statutes updated through 2025 Wis.

Stats.\n\n  42\n\nWhen after hearing a taxpayer[s complaint the board of review approved the as-\nsessor[s  valuation  by  giving  notice  affirming  the  assessment  under  sub.  (1),  the \nboard waived the requirement under sub. (7) (a) that the taxpayer[s objection be in \nwriting.  Fee v. Board of Review, 2003 WI App 17, 259 Wis. 2d 868, 657 N.W.2d \n112, 02-1758.\n\nNeither sub. (7) nor Hermann, 215 Wis. 2d 370 (1998), stand for the proposition \nthat a property owner may not raise any issue with the trial court that was not fully \nargued before the board of review.  Rather, Hermann explains that under sub. (7) any \nproperty owner wishing to challenge a property tax assessment, whether via certio-\nrari review, written complaint to the Department of Revenue, or a claim filed under \ns. 74.37, must first file an objection before the board.  U.S. Oil Co. v. City of Mil-\nwaukee, 2011 WI App 4, 331 Wis. 2d 407, 794 N.W.2d 904, 09-2260.\n\nHermann, 215 Wis. 2d 370 (1998), makes clear that exhaustion of remedies be-\nfore the board of review is required unless the property taxed is exempt or lies out-\nside of the taxing district.  An assertion that a city[s assessment process was flawed \nand unconstitutional, if true, would make the levy merely voidable, not void ab ini-\ntio.  Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 2011 WI App 117, 336 Wis. \n2d 707, 805 N.W.2d 582, 10-1809.\n\nA taxpayer who objects to an assessment on the basis of the classification of the \nproperty has the burden of proving that the classification is erroneous.  In this case, \nthe taxpayer did not meet the burden of proof, and the board of review[s determina-\ntion to maintain the assessment was supported by a reasonable view of the evidence.  \nSausen v. Town of Black Creek Board of Review, 2014 WI 9, 352 Wis. 2d 576, 843 \nN.W.2d 39, 10-3015.  See also Thoma v. Village of Slinger, 2018 WI 45, 381 Wis. \n2d 311, 912 N.W.2d 56, 15-1970.\n\nA property owner is absolved from complying with sub. (7)[s objection require-\nments when:  1) the property owner has filed a procedurally correct sub. (7) objec-\ntion to the property[s assessment in the prior year; 2) the assessment has not changed \nbetween the prior year and the current year; and 3) the prior year[s objection is still \nunresolved as of the date of the first meeting of the board of review for the current \nyear[s assessments.  Walgreen Co. v. City of Oshkosh, 2014 WI App 54, 354 Wis. 2d \n17, 848 N.W.2d 314, 13-1610.\n\nThe  plaintiffs  were  entitled  to  a  hearing  to  contest  their  tax  assessment  even \nthough  they  did  not  permit  a  tax  assessor  to  enter  the  interior  of  their  home.   \nMilewski v. Town of Dover, 2017 WI 79, 377 Wis. 2d 38, 899 N.W.2d 303, 15-1523.\nSub. (13) does not allow a taxation district to seek certiorari review of a decision \nof the board of review.  State ex rel. City of Waukesha v. City of Waukesha Board of \nReview, 2021 WI 89, 399 Wis. 2d 696, 967 N.W.2d 460, 19-1479.\n\nUnless a board of review waives the hearing provided under sub. (8), sub. (7) (a) \nrequires a taxpayer to affirmatively present evidence under oath in support of its ob-\njection, either by appearing in person at the hearing or, if permitted by the board of \nreview, by appearing via telephone or submitting written statements.  Sub. (7) (a) \nplainly  requires  a  taxpayer  to  do  more  than  file  an  objection  with  the  taxpayer[s \nopinion  of  the  property[s  value.    Wal-Mart  Real  Estate  Business  Trust  v.  City  of \nMerrill, 2023 WI App 14, 406 Wis. 2d 663, 987 N.W.2d 764, 21-0972.\n\nAlthough a board of review may waive a hearing, allow a taxpayer to appear at a \nhearing by telephone, or allow a taxpayer to submit written statements under oath, \nneither sub. (8) nor sub. (8m) requires the board to decide requests for such actions \nbefore beginning the hearing.  Likewise, a board is not required to grant a property \nowner[s request to postpone or reschedule a hearing under sub. (8).  In this case, \nwhen the board neither promised nor agreed to take any of those actions, the tax-\npayer was not denied due process.  Wal-Mart Real Estate Business Trust v. City of \nMerrill, 2023 WI App 14, 406 Wis. 2d 663, 987 N.W.2d 764, 21-0972.\n\nBoards of review cannot rely on exemptions in s. 19.85 (1) to close any meeting in \n\nview of explicit requirements in sub.

The assessor \nor  the  assessor[s  authorized  representative  shall  attend  without \norder or subpoena all hearings before the board of review and un-\nder  oath  submit  to  examination  and  fully  disclose  to  the  board \nsuch information as the assessor may have touching the assess-\nment and any other matters pertinent to the inquiry being made.  \nAll part-time assessors shall receive the same compensation for \nsuch attendance as is allowed to the members of the board but no \ncounty assessor or member of a county assessor[s staff shall re-\nceive any compensation other than that person[s regular salary for \nattendance at a board of review.  The clerk shall make all correc-\ntions to the assessment roll ordered by the board of review, in-\ncluding all changes in the valuation of real property.  When any \nvaluation of real property is changed, the clerk shall enter the val-\nuation fixed by the board in the proper class and enter a note of \nthe  valuation  of  the  assessor  and  the  change  to  that  valuation \nmade by the board.  The clerk shall also enter upon the assess-\nment roll, in the proper place, the names of all persons found li-\nable to taxation on personal property by the board of review, set-\nting opposite such names respectively the aggregate valuation of \nsuch property as determined by the assessor, after deducting ex-\nemptions and making such corrections as the board has ordered.  \n\nAll changes in valuation of personal property made by the board \nof review shall be made in the same manner as changes in real \nestate.\n\nHistory:  1991 a. 316; 2023 a. 138.\n\n70.49  Affidavit of assessor.  (1)  Before the meeting of the \nboard of review, the assessor shall attach to the completed assess-\nment roll an affidavit in a form prescribed by the department of \nrevenue.\n\n(2)  The value of all real property entered into the assessment \nroll to which such affidavit is attached by the assessor shall, in all \nactions  and  proceedings  involving  such  values,  be  presumptive \nevidence that all such properties have been justly and equitably \nassessed in proper relationship to each other.\n\n(3)  No assessor shall be allowed in any court or place by oath \nor testimony to contradict or impeach any affidavit or certificate \nmade or signed by the assessor as assessor.\n\n(4)  In this section XassessorY means an assessor or any person \n\nappointed or designated under s. 70.055 or 70.75.\n\nHistory:  1991 a. 316; 1993 a. 307; 2023 a. 12.\nPursuant to sub. (2), the presumption of correctness afforded to an assessment at-\ntaches at the filing of the assessment by the assessor along with the required affi-\ndavit.  If an assessment is conducted contrary to the dictates of the Property Assess-\nment  Manual,  that  does  not  mean  that  the  presumption  does  not  initially  attach.   \nRather, if, in the context of a s. 74.37 action, the failure to follow the manual results \nin an excessive assessment, then the presumption is overcome and the assessment \nmust be set aside.

(a)  If the reviewing authority has \nnot made a determination prior to the time of the tax levy with re-\nspect to a particular objection to the amount, valuation or taxabil-\nity of property, the tax levy on the property or person shall be \nbased on the contested assessed value of the property.  A tax bill \nshall be sent to, and paid by, the person subject to the tax levy as \nthough there had been no objection filed, except that the payment \nshall be considered to be made under protest.  The entire tax bill \nshall  be  paid  when  due  under  s.  74.11,  74.12  or  74.87  even \nthough the reviewing authority has reduced the assessment prior \nto the time for full payment of the tax billed.  The requirement to \npay a tax timely under this paragraph does not apply to taxes due \nand payable in 2020 if paid by October 1, 2020, or by any install-\nment date for which taxes are due after October 1, 2020, nor to \n\ntaxes due and payable in 2021 if paid by October 1, 2021, or by \nany  installment  date  for  which  taxes  are  due  after  October  1, \n2021.\n\n(b)  If the reviewing authority reduces the value of the prop-\nerty in question, or determines that manufacturing property is ex-\nempt, the taxpayer may file a claim for refund of taxes resulting \nfrom the reduction in value or determination that the property is \nexempt.  If claim for refund is filed with the clerk of the munici-\npality on or before the November 1 following the decision of the \nreviewing  authority,  the  claim  shall  be  payable  to  the  taxpayer \nfrom the municipality no later than January 31 of the succeeding \nyear.  A claim filed after November 1 shall be paid to the taxpayer \nby  the  municipality  no  later  than  the  2nd  January  31  after  the \nclaim is filed.  Interest on the claim shall be paid to the taxpayer \nwhen the claim is paid at the average annual discount rate deter-\nmined by the last auction of 6-month U.S. treasury bills before \nthe  objection  per  day  for  the  period  of  time  between  the  time \nwhen the tax was due and the date that the claim was paid.  If the \ntaxpayer requests a postponement of proceedings before the re-\nviewing  authority,  interest  on  the  claim  shall  permanently  stop \naccruing at the date of the request.  If the hearing is postponed at \nthe request of the taxpayer, the reviewing authority shall hold a \nhearing on the appeal within 30 days after the postponement is \nrequested unless the taxpayer agrees to a longer delay.  If the re-\nviewing authority postpones the hearing without a request by the \ntaxpayer, interest on the claim shall continue to accrue.  No inter-\nest  may  be  paid  if  the  reviewing  authority  determines  under  s. \n70.995 (8) (a) that the value of the property was reduced because \nthe taxpayer supplied false or incomplete information.  If taxes \nare refunded, the municipality may proceed under s. 74.41.\n\n(bm)  No later than July 1 of each year, each municipality that \npays a refund under par. (b) for property that is assessed under s. \n70.995  shall  notify  the  department  of  administration  of  the \namount of all such refunds paid by the municipality in the previ-\nous fiscal year.  Annually, no later than the 3rd Monday in No-\nvember, from the appropriation account under s. 20.835 (2) (br), \nthe department of administration shall pay to each municipality \nthat pays a refund under par. (b) for property that is assessed un-\nder s. 70.995 an amount that is equal to 20 percent of the interest \non such refunds paid by the municipality in the previous fiscal \nyear and that has accrued up to the date of the determination by \nthe tax appeals commission of the municipality[s obligation.\n\n(c)  If the reviewing authority increases the value of the prop-\nerty in question, the increase in value shall in the case of manu-\nfacturing property assessed by the department of revenue under s. \n70.995  be  assessed  as  omitted  property  as  prescribed  under  s. \n70.995 (12).

The clerk shall correct all double as-\nsessments, imperfect descriptions, and other errors apparent on \nthe roll, and correct the value of parcels of real property not liable \nto taxation.  The clerk shall add to the roll any parcel of real prop-\nerty not listed on the assessment roll and immediately notify the \nassessors of the additions and omissions.  The assessors shall im-\nmediately  view  and  value  the  omitted  property  and  certify  the \nvaluation  to  the  clerk.

From all the \nsources of information accessible to it the department shall deter-\nmine and assess by class the value of all property subject to gen-\neral property taxation in each county and taxation district.  If the \ndepartment is satisfied that the assessment by a county assessor \nunder s. 70.99 is at full value, it may adopt that value as the state[s \nfull value.\n\n(b)  The department shall set down a list of all the counties and \ntaxation  districts  and  opposite  to  the  name  of  each  county  and \ntaxation  district  the  valuation  determined  by  the  department, \nwhich shall be the full value according to its best judgment.\n\n(c)  There shall also be prepared a list of all the counties of the \nstate with the valuation determined for each county listed oppo-\nsite the name of the county.  The list shall be certified by the sec-\nretary of revenue as the assessment of the counties of the state \nmade  by  the  department  and  be  delivered  to  the  department  of \nadministration.\n\n(d)  In any case where the department, through mistake or in-\nadvertence, has assessed to any county or taxation district, in the \ncurrent year or in the previous year, a greater or less valuation for \nany year than should have been assessed, it shall correct the error.  \nThe department shall add or subtract, as the case may be, from \nthe valuation of the county or taxation district, as determined by \nthe department at the assessment in the year after the error is dis-\ncovered, the amount omitted from or added to the true valuation \nof the county in the former assessment in consequence of the er-\nror.  The result shall be taken as the full value of the county for \nthe latter year and a final correction of the error.\n\n(1b)  On or before August 1 of each year, the department of \nrevenue shall publish on its Internet site for each county and taxa-\ntion  district  a  preliminary  determination  of  its  equalized  value, \ntax  incremental  finance  district  values  as  provided  under  s. \n66.1105 (5) (g) and (6), and net new construction value as pro-\nvided under ss. 66.0602 and 79.05.

The de-\npartment of revenue shall make available to each taxation district \na  list  of  sales  within  the  taxation  district  and  shall  indicate \nwhether or not those sales were used or rejected in establishing \nequalized value.  If insufficient residential and agricultural sales \nin a taxation district require the department to use sales informa-\ntion from other taxation districts in establishing equalized value, \nthe department shall so notify the affected taxation district and, \nupon written request from that taxation district, shall make avail-\nable to the taxation district the sales information from other taxa-\ntion districts and other information used to establish the equal-\nized value.  Upon resolution by the governing body of a county or \ntaxation district, the department shall review the equalized value \nestablished for the county or taxation district.\n\n(2)  (a)  If the state board of assessors, the tax appeals com-\nmission or a court makes a final redetermination on the assess-\nment of property subject to taxation under s. 70.995 that is higher \nor lower than the previous assessment, the department of revenue \nshall recertify the equalized value of the school district in which \nthe property subject to taxation under s. 70.995 is located.\n\n(b)  If a court makes a final redetermination on the assessment \nof  telephone  company  property  subject  to  taxation  under  s. \n70.112 (4) and subch.

(a) shall use the pay-\nments to make loans to persons who own property located in the \ntaxation  district  and  who  are  paying  more  property  taxes  than \nthey should be as a result of the error.  A person may receive a \nloan by applying, in the manner prescribed by the department, to \nthe taxation district in which the person[s property is located no \nlater than June 15 of the year following the error.  The state shall \ncollect the amount of any loan issued under this paragraph as a \nstate special charge against the taxation district for the year after \nthe year in which the error occurred and the special charge shall \nnot be included in the taxation district[s levy.  The taxation dis-\ntrict shall assess the loan amount as a special charge against the \nproperty  for  which  the  loan  was  made  on  the  property  tax  bill \nsucceeding the loan, as provided under ch. 74 and s. 66.0627 (1) \n(c).  Except for interest and penalties, as provided under s. 74.47, \nthat  apply  to  any  delinquent  special  charge  based  on  the  loan \namount,  neither  the  department  nor  the  taxation  district  may \ncharge  interest  on  any  loan  issued  under  this  paragraph.    The \n\nmaximum loan amount that a person may receive under this para-\ngraph shall be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the \nperson[s property by a decimal determined by the department as \nfollows:\n\n1.  For the year in which the error occurred, apportion county, \nschool district, technical college district, and metropolitan sewer-\nage district property taxes to the taxation district using the taxa-\ntion district[s erroneous valuation.\n\n2.  For the year in which the error occurred, apportion county, \nschool district, technical college district, and metropolitan sewer-\nage district property taxes to the taxation district using the taxa-\ntion district[s correct valuation.\n\n3.  Subtract the amount determined under subd. 2. from the \n\namount determined under subd. 1.\n\n4.  Divide the amount determined under subd. 3. by the taxa-\ntion district[s assessed value for the year in which the error oc-\ncurred and express the result as a decimal.\n\n(c)  With regard to loans made under par. (b), the department \nshall  make  the  payments  under  par.  (a)  monthly,  based  on  the \namounts  requested  in  loan  applications  to  the  taxation  district \neach month, except that the department shall make no payments \nto a taxation district after June 30 of the year following the year in \nwhich the error occurred.\n\n(d)  If property tax bills for the assessment year in which the \nerror relates have not been distributed to property owners, the de-\npartment may make one payment from the appropriation under s. \n20.566 (2) (b) to the taxation district to reduce the property taxes \nthat would otherwise be imposed as a result of the error.  The de-\npartment shall confirm the amount of the payment and provide \nguidance to the taxation district in allocating the amount to spe-\ncific parcels.  In the year following the error, the taxation district, \nwith the guidance of the department, shall collect from property \nowners in the taxation district an amount equal to the amount of \nthe payment and shall remit the amount collected to the depart-\nment.  The department may not charge interest for any payment \nunder this paragraph.  Notwithstanding s. 66.0602 or 79.05, pay-\nments under this paragraph in both the year the payment is made \nto the taxation district and the year the taxation district returns \nthe payment to the department shall not be included in determin-\ning the taxation district[s or the county[s levy, or allowable levy \nunder s. 66.0602, or in determining the taxation district[s eligibil-\nity  for,  and  calculation  of  payments,  under  s.79.05.    Solely  for \npurposes  of  relating  annual  revenue  to  estimated  expenses,  the \namounts collected and remitted to the state under this paragraph \nshall be deemed accrued receipts as of the close of the fiscal year, \nbut no revenue shall be deemed accrued receipts unless it is de-\nposited by this state on or before August 31.\n\nHistory:  1973 c. 90, 336; 1977 c. 29 ss. 761, 762, 1647 (12); 1977 c. 300 ss. 5, 8; \n1981 c. 20; 1983 a. 372; 1985 a. 29, 54, 153, 246, 332, 399; 1991 a. 39; 1995 a. 27, \n225; 2003 a. 33; 2007 a. 4; 2009 a. 11; 2011 a. 64; 2015 a. 321; 2017 a. 59.\n\nCross-reference:  See also ch.

Sub-\nject to subd. 2. and sub. (1m), if the department finds that the as-\nsessment of property in the taxation district is not in substantial \ncompliance with the law and that the interest of the public will be \npromoted  by  a  reassessment,  the  department  may  order  a  re-\nassessment of all or of any part of the taxable property in the dis-\ntrict to be made by one or more persons appointed for that pur-\npose by the department.\n\n2.  The department may dismiss any petition for reassessment \nif, prior to the entry of a reassessment order under subd. 1., the \ntaxation district involved determines under s. 70.055 that employ-\ning expert help to aid in assessing property would be in the public \ninterest and if, after receiving departmental approval, the taxation \ndistrict does employ expert help for either of the 2 years following \nthe assessment year complained of.\n\n3.  If the department performs the reassessment or special su-\npervision under sub. (3), the department shall designate the per-\nson responsible for the reassessment.  If the department appoints \na corporation for the reassessment or special supervision under \nsub.  (3),  the  corporation  shall  designate  the  person  responsible \nfor  the  reassessment.

If a petition under subd. 1. is filed in the office of the de-\npartment the department shall, under the powers conferred by s. \n73.03 (1), review the assessment complained of.  If the depart-\n\nment finds the assessment is not in substantial compliance with \nlaw and that public interest will be promoted by a reassessment, it \nshall  correct  such  assessment  by  a  reassessment  as  provided  in \nthis section.  The department[s duty to reassess is not impaired by \nany action, subsequent to such filing, of any taxpayer represented \nin the application.\n\n5.  As a part of its investigation of the assessment complained \nof, the department shall hold a hearing at some convenient place \nwithin  or  near  the  taxation  district  which  is  sought  to  be  re-\nassessed.  At such hearing testimony may be offered as to the in-\nequality or equality of the assessment, whether or not the public \ninterest will be promoted by a reassessment and as to such other \nmatters as may be desired by the department.  Notice of the hear-\ning specifying the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed to \nthe clerk of the taxation district and the first signer of the applica-\ntion for reassessment, not less than 8 days before the time fixed \nfor the hearing.\n\n6.

(1) and (2) Xmanufacturing, assem-\nbling, processing, fabricating, making or millingY includes the en-\ntire productive process and includes such activities as the storage \nof  raw  materials,  the  movement  thereof  to  the  first  operation \nthereon, and the packaging, bottling, crating or similar prepara-\ntion of products for shipment.\n\n(4)  Whenever real property is used for one, or some combina-\ntion, of the processes mentioned in sub. (3) and also for other pur-\nposes,  the  department  of  revenue,  if  satisfied  that  there  is  sub-\nstantial use in one or some combination of such processes, may \nassess the property under this section.  For all purposes of this \nsection the department of revenue shall have sole discretion for \nthe determination of what is substantial use and what description \nof real property shall constitute Xthe propertyY to be included for \nassessment  purposes,  and,  in  connection  herewith,  the  depart-\nment may include in a real property unit, real property owned by \ndifferent persons.  Vacant property designed for use in manufac-\nturing,  assembling,  processing,  fabricating,  making,  or  milling \ntangible property for profit may be assessed under this section or \nunder s. 70.32 (1), and the period of vacancy may not be the sole \nground for making that determination.  In those specific instances \nwhere a portion of a description of real property includes manu-\nfacturing  property  rented  or  leased  and  operated  by  a  separate \nperson which does not satisfy the substantial use qualification for \nthe entire property, the local assessor shall assess the entire real \nproperty description).\n\n(5)  The  department  of  revenue  shall  assess  all  property  of \nmanufacturing establishments included under subs.

A change in ownership or \nname of the manufacturing establishment does not necessitate a \nnew request.  In assessing lands from which metalliferous miner-\nals are being extracted and valued for purposes of the tax under s. \n70.375,  the  value  of  the  metalliferous  mineral  content  of  such \nlands shall be excluded.\n\n(5n)  (a)  If the department of revenue determines that an es-\ntablishment  is  engaged  in  manufacturing,  as  described  in  subs. \n(1), (2), and (3), the department may classify the establishment as \nmanufacturing.  The establishment shall submit a written request \non or before July 1 of the year for which classification is desired, \nas provided under s. 71.07 (5n) (a) 9. c. or 71.28 (5n) (a) 9. c.  \nAny establishment classified as manufacturing prior to January 1, \n2024, is presumed to be engaged in manufacturing, as described \nin subs. (1), (2), and (3), and need not submit a request as pro-\nvided in this paragraph.\n\n(b)  The department may at any time investigate or audit re-\nquests submitted under par. (a) and may revoke a classification.  \nA  revocation  under  this  paragraph  may  not  apply  retroactively, \nbut shall take effect on the first day of the establishment[s taxable \nyear following the year in which the department issues a revoca-\ntion.  An establishment that submits a request under par. (a) shall \nnotify the department within 60 days of any termination of manu-\nfacturing activity.\n\n(c)  On or before December 31 of the year in which a request is \ntimely submitted under par. (a), the department shall issue a no-\ntice of determination responding to the timely request.  The de-\npartment may, in its sole discretion, issue a notice of determina-\ntion by December 31 for requests received after July 1 of the year \nin which classification is desired.  The notice shall be in writing \nand shall be sent by 1st class mail or electronic mail.  In addition, \nthe  notice  shall  specify  that  objections  to  the  decision  shall  be \nfiled with the state board of assessors no later than 60 days after \nthe date of the notice, that a fee of $200 shall be paid when the \nobjection is filed, and that the objection is not filed until the fee is \npaid.\n\n(d)  For purposes of this subsection, an objection is considered \ntimely  filed  if  received  by  the  state  board  of  assessors  no  later \nthan 60 days after the date of the notice or sent to the state board \nof assessors by U.S. postal service certified mail in a properly ad-\ndressed  envelope,  with  postage  paid,  that  is  postmarked  before \nmidnight of the last day for filing.  Neither the board nor the tax \nappeals commission may waive the requirement that objections \nbe in writing.\n\n(e)  The state board of assessors shall investigate any objection \ntimely  filed  under  par.  (d)  if  the  fee  specified  under  par.  (c)  is \npaid.  The board shall notify the person objecting or the person[s \nagent of its determination by 1st class mail or electronic mail.\n\n(f)  If a determination of the state board of assessors under par. \n(e) results in an establishment not being classified as manufactur-\ning, the person having been notified of the determination shall be \ndeemed  to  have  accepted  the  determination  unless  the  person \nfiles a petition for review with the clerk of the tax appeals com-\nmission, as provided under s. 73.01 (5) and the rules of practice \nof the tax appeals commission.\n\n(6)  Prior to February 15 of each year the department of rev-\nenue shall notify each municipal assessor of the manufacturing \nproperty within the taxation district that, as of that date, will be \nassessed by the department during the current assessment year.\n\n(7)  (a)  Each manufacturing property assessed by the depart-\nment of revenue shall be entered on a state manufacturing prop-\nerty assessment roll for each municipality that has manufacturing \nproperty as set forth in subs. (1) and (2).  Notification of the indi-\nvidual manufacturing property assessments contained in the roll \nshall be furnished by the department to the municipal clerk.\n\n(b)  Each 5 years, or more frequently if the department of rev-\nenue[s workload permits and if in the department[s judgment it is \ndesirable, the department of revenue shall complete a field inves-\ntigation or on-site appraisal at full value under s. 70.32 (1) of all \nmanufacturing real property in this state.\n\n(8)  (a)  The secretary of revenue shall establish a state board \nof assessors, which shall be comprised of the members of the de-\npartment  of  revenue  whom  the  secretary  designates.    The  state \nboard of assessors shall investigate any timely objection filed un-\nder par. (c) or (d) if the fee under that paragraph is paid.  The state \nboard of assessors, after having made the investigation, shall no-\ntify the person assessed or the person[s agent and the appropriate \nmunicipality of its determination by 1st class mail or electronic \nmail.  Beginning with objections filed in 1989, the state board of \nassessors shall make its determination on or before April 1 of the \nyear after the filing.

Stats.\n\nGENERAL PROPERTY TAXES\n\n70.995\n\nproperty taxes paid, the state board of assessors shall include in \nthe determination a finding of whether the refund is due to false \nor incomplete information supplied by the person assessed.  The \nperson assessed or the municipality having been notified of the \ndetermination of the state board of assessors shall be deemed to \nhave accepted the determination unless the person or municipal-\nity  files  a  petition  for  review  with  the  clerk  of  the  tax  appeals \ncommission as provided in s. 73.01 (5) and the rules of practice \npromulgated by the commission.  If an assessment is reduced by \nthe state board of assessors, the municipality affected may file an \nappeal seeking review of the reduction, or may, within 30 days af-\nter the person assessed files a petition for review, file a cross-ap-\npeal, before the tax appeals commission even though the munici-\npality did not file an objection to the assessment with the board.  \nIf the board does not overrule a change from assessment under \nthis section to assessment under s. 70.32 (1), the affected munici-\npality may file an appeal before the tax appeals commission.  If \nan assessment is increased by the board, the person assessed may \nfile an appeal seeking review of the increase, or may, within 30 \ndays after the municipality files a petition for review, file a cross-\nappeal, before the commission even though the person did not file \nan objection to the assessment with the board.\n\n(b)  1.  The department of revenue shall annually notify each \nmanufacturer assessed under this section and the municipality in \nwhich the manufacturing property is located of the full value of \nall real property owned by the manufacturer.  The notice shall be \nin writing and shall be sent by 1st class mail or electronic mail.  In \naddition,  the  notice  shall  specify  that  objections  to  valuation, \namount, or taxability must be filed with the state board of asses-\nsors no later than 60 days after the date of the notice of assess-\nment, that objections to a change from assessment under this sec-\ntion to assessment under s. 70.32 (1) must be filed no later than \n60 days after the date of the notice, that the fee under par. (c) 1. or \n(d) must be paid and that the objection is not filed until the fee is \npaid.  For purposes of this subdivision, an objection is considered \ntimely  filed  if  received  by  the  state  board  of  assessors  no  later \nthan 60 days after the date of the notice or sent to the state board \nof assessors by certified mail in a properly addressed envelope, \nwith postage paid, that is postmarked before midnight of the last \nday for filing.  A statement shall be attached to the assessment \nroll indicating that the notices required by this section have been \nmailed and failure to receive the notice does not affect the validity \nof the assessments, the resulting tax on real property, the proce-\ndures of the tax appeals commission or of the state board of as-\nsessors,  or  the  enforcement  of  delinquent  taxes  by  statutory \nmeans.\n\n2.  If a municipality files an objection to the amount, valua-\ntion, taxability, or change from assessment under this section and \nthe  person  assessed  does  not  file  an  objection,  the  person  as-\nsessed may file an appeal within 15 days after the municipality[s \nobjection is filed.\n\n(c)  1.  All objections to the amount, valuation, taxability, or \nchange from assessment under this section to assessment under s. \n70.32 (1) of property shall be first made in writing on a form pre-\nscribed by the department of revenue that specifies that the objec-\ntor shall set forth the reasons for the objection, the objector[s esti-\nmate of the correct assessment, and the basis under s. 70.32 (1) \nfor the objector[s estimate of the correct assessment.  An objec-\ntion shall be filed with the state board of assessors within the time \nprescribed in par. (b) 1.  A $200 fee shall be paid when the objec-\ntion is filed unless a fee has been paid in respect to the same piece \nof property and that appeal has not been finally adjudicated.  The \nobjection is not filed until the fee is paid.  Neither the state board \nof assessors nor the tax appeals commission may waive the re-\nquirement that objections be in writing.  Persons who own land \nand improvements to that land may object to the aggregate value \n\nof that land and improvements to that land, but no person who \nowns land and improvements to that land may object only to the \nvaluation of that land or only to the valuation of improvements to \nthat land.\n\n2.  A manufacturer who files an objection under subd. 1. may \nfile supplemental information to support the manufacturer[s ob-\njection no later than 60 days from the date the objection is filed.  \nThe  state  board  of  assessors  shall  notify  the  municipality  in \nwhich the manufacturer[s property is located of supplemental in-\nformation filed by the manufacturer under this subdivision, if the \nmunicipality has filed an appeal related to the objection.\n\n(d)  A municipality may file an objection with the state board \nof assessors to the amount, valuation, or taxability under this sec-\ntion or to the change from assessment under this section to assess-\nment under s. 70.32 (1) of a specific property having a situs in the \nmunicipality, whether or not the owner of the specific property in \nquestion  has  filed  an  objection.    Objection  shall  be  made  on  a \nform  prescribed  by  the  department  and  filed  with  the  board \nwithin the time prescribed in par. (b) 1.  If the person assessed \nfiles an objection and the municipality affected does not file an \nobjection, the municipality affected may file an appeal to that ob-\njection  within  15  days  after  the  person[s  objection  is  filed.    A \n$200 filing fee shall be paid when the objection is filed unless a \nfee has been paid in respect to the same piece of property and that \nappeal has not been finally adjudicated.  The objection is not filed \nuntil the fee is paid.  The board shall forthwith notify the person \nassessed of the objection filed by the municipality.\n\n(dm)  The department shall refund filing fees paid under par. \n(c) 1. or (d) if the appeal in respect to the fee is denied because of \nlack of jurisdiction.\n\n(e)  Upon completion of and review by the tax appeals com-\nmission and receipt of the statement of assessments required un-\nder s. 70.53, the department of revenue shall be responsible for \nequating  all  full-value  manufacturing  property  assessments  en-\ntered in the manufacturing property assessment roll to the general \nlevel of assessment of all other property within the individual tax-\nation district.  Thereafter, the manufacturing property assessment \nroll shall be delivered to the municipal clerk and annexed to the \nmunicipal assessment roll containing all other property.\n\n(f)  No manufacturing property assessment may be reviewed \nin a proceeding under s. 70.75 or 70.85, but such assessment may \nbe reviewed in reassessment proceedings under s. 70.75 (1).\n\nCross-reference:  See also ch. TA 1, Wis. adm. code.\n(9)  Any aggrieved party may appeal a determination by the \ntax  appeals  commission  under  sub.  (8)  to  the  circuit  court  for \nDane County under s. 73.015 or to the circuit court for the county \nwhere the taxpayer[s commercial domicile, as defined in s. 71.01 \n(1b), is located, where the taxpayer owns other property, or where \nthe taxpayer transacts business in this state.\n\n(10)  Municipalities, and counties with a county assessor sys-\ntem, shall have access to all manufacturing property for the pur-\npose of making appraisals of valuation of such property and may \nemploy appraisal personnel, who need not be certified under s. \n70.05 (4), for such purpose.\n\n(11)  If any county appoints a county assessor under s. 70.99, \nthe department of revenue shall nevertheless assess the property \ndescribed in subs. (1) and (2) and shall continue to assess such \nproperty when required by this section, and the notice to the mu-\nnicipal assessor required by sub. (6) shall, in such case be made \ndirectly to the county assessor.\n\n(12)  (a)  The department of revenue shall prescribe a standard \nmanufacturing property report form that shall be submitted annu-\nally for each real estate parcel on or before March 1 by all manu-\nfacturers whose property is assessed under this section.

Failure to submit the report shall re-\nsult in denial of any right of redetermination by the state board of \nassessors or the tax appeals commission.  If any property is omit-\nted or understated in the manufacturing real estate assessment roll \nin any of the next 5 previous years, or in a manufacturing personal \nproperty assessment roll made before January 1, 2024, the asses-\nsor shall enter the value of the omitted or understated property \nonce for each previous year of the omission or understatement.  \nThe assessor shall affix a just valuation to each entry for a former \nyear as it should have been assessed according to the assessor[s \nbest judgment.  Taxes shall be apportioned and collected on the \ntax roll for each entry, on the basis of the net tax rate for the year \nof the omission, taking into account credits under s. 79.10.  In the \ncase  of  omitted  property,  interest  shall  be  added  at  the  rate  of \n0.0267 percent per day for the period of time between the date \nwhen the form is required to be submitted and the date when the \nassessor affixes the just valuation.  In the case of underpayments \ndetermined after an objection under sub. (8) (d), interest shall be \nadded at the average annual discount interest rate determined by \nthe last auction of 6-month U.S. treasury bills before the objec-\ntion per day for the period of time between the date when the tax \nwas due and the date when it is paid.\n\n(b)    The  department  of  revenue  shall  allow  an  extension  to \nApril 1 of the due date for filing the report forms required under \npar. (a) if a written application for an extension, stating the reason \nfor the request, is filed with the department on or before March 1.\n(c)  Unless the taxpayer shows that the failure is due to reason-\nable cause, if a taxpayer fails to file any form required under par. \n(a) for property that the department of revenue assessed during \nthe previous year by the due date or by any extension of the due \ndate that has been granted, the taxpayer shall pay to the depart-\nment of revenue a penalty of $25 if the form is filed 1 to 10 days \nlate;  $50  or  0.05  percent  of  the  previous  year[s  assessment, \nwhichever is greater, but not more than $250, if the form is filed \n11 to 30 days late; and $100 or 0.1 percent of the previous year[s \nassessment, whichever is greater, but not more than $750, if the \nform is filed more than 30 days late.  Penalties are due 30 days af-\nter they are assessed and are delinquent if not paid on or before \nthat date.  The department may refund all or part of any penalty it \nassesses under this paragraph if it finds reasonable grounds for \nlate filing.\n\n(d)  Sections 71.82 (2) (a) and 71.91 (4) to (6), as they apply to \n\nthe taxes under ch. 71, apply to the penalties under par. (c).\n\n(12m)  Any property assessment increased by the reviewing \nauthority under s. 70.511 shall be entered in the assessment roll \nas prescribed under sub. (12).\n\n(12r)  The department of revenue shall calculate the value of \nproperty that is used in manufacturing, as defined in this section, \nand that is exempt under s. 70.11 (39) and (39m).\n\n(13)  In the sections of this chapter relating to assessment of \nproperty, when the property involved is a manufacturing property \nsubject to assessment under this section, the terms Xlocal asses-\nsorY or XassessorY shall be deemed to refer also to the department \nof revenue except as provided in sub. (10).\n\n(14)  (a)  Beginning with the property tax assessments as of \nJanuary 1, 2003, the department of revenue shall annually impose \non each municipality in which manufacturing property is located \na fee in an amount that is equal to the equalized value of the man-\nufacturing  property  located  in  the  municipality  multiplied  by  a \nrate that is determined annually by the department so that the to-\ntal amount collected under this paragraph is sufficient to pay for \n50 percent of the budgeted costs to the department in the current \nstate fiscal year associated with the assessment of manufacturing \nproperty under this section.  Except as provided in par. (b), each \nmunicipality that is assessed a fee under this paragraph shall col-\nlect the amount of the fee as a special charge against the taxable \nproperty located in the municipality, except that no municipality \nmay  apply  the  special  charge  disproportionately  to  owners  of \nmanufacturing property relative to owners of other property.\n\n(b)  If the department of revenue does not receive the fee im-\nposed on a municipality under par. (a) by March 31 of each year, \nthe department shall reduce the distribution made to the munici-\npality under s. 79.02 (1) by the amount of the fee.\n\nHistory:  1973 c. 90, 283, 333; 1975 c. 39, 144, 199, 200, 213, 224; 1977 c. 29 ss. \n776 to 782, 1646 (3), 1647 (5m), 1656 (38); 1977 c. 31, 142, 272; 1977 c. 300 ss. 7, \n8; 1977 c. 328, 377, 418, 447; 1979 c. 34 ss. 883m, 2102 (39) (g); 1979 c. 221; 1981 \nc. 20; 1983 a. 27; 1983 a. 275 s. 15 (8); 1985 a. 29; 1985 a. 120 s. 3202 (46); 1987 \na. 27, 196, 399; 1989 a. 31; 1991 a. 39, 269; 1993 a. 307, 391; 1995 a. 227, 408; \n1997 a. 35, 237, 250; 1999 a. 32; 2001 a. 16, 109; 2003 a. 33, 170; 2013 a. 20, 54; \n2021 a. 1, 239; 2023 a. 12; s. 35.17 correction in (12) (a).\n\nCross-reference:  See also s.

(1) or is not listed under sub. (2), the Property Assess-\nment Manual may be looked to, to determine if property is manufacturing property.  \nThe manual provides that the general definition under sub. (1) (a) and (b) is to be \nconsidered and supplies three questions to be used in applying the definition.  Zip \nSort, Inc. v.

The 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual, and not subse-\nquently revised versions of the manual, must be followed under sub. (2) until the leg-\nislature directs otherwise.  When the taxpayer[s activities did not fit squarely into a \nparticular SIC Manual category, the commission then reasonably looked to the gen-\neral definition of manufacturing in the SIC Manual to assist it in classifying the fa-\ncility.

Under this section, a notice of assessment is required only when the prop-\nerty[s assessed value has changed.  After reading these statutes, it should have been\nclear to the taxpayer that:  1) because it did not receive a notice of assessment, its\nproperty[s assessed value for 2011 would be unchanged from 2010; and 2) if the tax-\npayer wanted to challenge the 2011 assessment, it needed to object before the board\nof review.
