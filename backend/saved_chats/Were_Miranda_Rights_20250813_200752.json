      "question": "what were miranda rights created as a result of and when?",
      "answer": "Miranda Rights were created as a result of the United States Supreme Court case of Miranda v. Arizona in 1966. The Miranda warning is intended to protect a suspect's Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer self-incriminating questions. The rights include the right to remain silent, the warning that anything said can be used against the individual in court, the right to an attorney, and the provision that if the individual cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed.",
