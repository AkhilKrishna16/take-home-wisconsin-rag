      "question": "what are miranda rights?",
      "answer": "Miranda rights, also known as Miranda warnings, are a set of rights that must be read to individuals in police custody before they are interrogated. These rights originate from the U.S. Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). The Miranda rights include the right to remain silent, the warning that anything said can be used against the individual in court, the right to an attorney, and the right to have an attorney appointed if the individual cannot afford one.\n\nIt is crucial for law enforcement to inform individuals of their Miranda rights to protect their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a person in custody is not properly informed of their Miranda rights and is subsequently interrogated, any statements made during that interrogation may be deemed inadmissible in court.\n\nIt's important to note that Miranda rights only apply to custodial interrogations, where a person is in police custody and being questioned in a way that is likely to elicit an incriminating response. If these rights are not respected, any resulting statements may be excluded from trial under the \"Miranda rule.\"",
