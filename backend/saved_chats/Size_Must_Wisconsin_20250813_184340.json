      "question": "what size must the wisconsin flag be?",
      "answer": "The Wisconsin state flag must adhere to specific dimensions as outlined in the law. According to Wisconsin Statute 1.08, the relative dimensions of the Wisconsin state flag should be 2 to 3, hoist to fly. This means that the flag's height (hoist) should be two-thirds of its length (fly). This requirement ensures that the flag maintains the proper proportions when displayed.",
