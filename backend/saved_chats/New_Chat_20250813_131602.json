      "question": "what are miranda rights?",
      "answer": "Miranda rights, also known as Miranda warnings, are a set of rights that must be read to individuals in police custody before they are interrogated. These rights originate from the U.S. Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). The Miranda warnings include the following elements:\n\n1. The right to remain silent: The individual has the right to refuse to answer any questions.\n2. Anything they say can be used against them in court.\n3. The right to an attorney: The individual has the right to have an attorney present during questioning.\n4. If they cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to them.\n\nThese rights are intended to protect individuals from self-incrimination and ensure that their Fifth Amendment rights against compelled self-incrimination are upheld during police interrogations. It's crucial for law enforcement to inform individuals of their Miranda rights to safeguard the admissibility of any statements made during custodial interrogations in court.",
